(pauses) Like they've been practicing for years.  'I'm sending a smiling face'... no, mom, that's just a 😊 – it doesn't mean 'I love your cooking.' It means I don't want to be there anymore.  And then there's dad with his 🤣. You're not funny; that was just a fart joke from last night's dinner. Stop trying to relate!  But my favorite is when they send a 👍. What does that even mean? 'Good job'? No, dad, that's just a thumbs up from a beer commercial.  We should start an emoji support group for confused kids like me.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI've been seeing this thing that's happened, where my mum has started sending me messages on her phone with these little pictures she calls emojis. Do you know what an emoji is? It's like one of those pictures you can send to someone when you're trying to convey meaning without actually saying anything. So it makes sense because I'm not allowed to say certain things so now instead of coming out with all sorts of terrible comebacks or insults that would really hurt people if they were said aloud... ...she'll just send them via pictogram. That was nice wasn't it? Yeah but there's no escape from it though is there because even at work i get them sometimes from customers right well we have got some quite rude people working for us which isn't ideal uh. But um anyway i don't mind being sent rude comments by customers at work because most times they mean something completely different than what they look like, right? They usually end up looking innocent, yeah? Like recently I had somebody complain about our food hygiene standards and then sign off their complaint email with a smiling poop icon. Right, how does that make any kind of sense? What's going through his head, eh? He must be thinking, oh, yes, it will only take two weeks maximum before I am forced into exile. Thank you very much. And also, thank you for having me. That means a lot. It doesn't matter whether you agree with everything I say, it's the fact that you let me say it that matters. Oh, and also, you might want to think twice next time you put chicken in the oven. What did he expect me to do with that information? Put it on Facebook? Give him five stars? No wonder why fast-food places go bankrupt. Weirdos. Honestly, customer service used to be a job for friendly old men who'd give out free chocolate coins, remember those guys? Now it's weirdo teenagers who tell you you should f*** yourself. Really? Really? You want to fight? Let's f***ing see! No wonder we're losing wars! Can we please bring back good manners? People need to stop getting angry over Twitter, okay? Just calm down. Just breathe. Take three deep breaths. If you still feel annoyed after taking three deep breaths, ask yourself this question. Would Jesus tweet? Answer honestly. He wouldn't, would he? Because Jesus loved everyone equally. And that's not gonna play in 140 characters, okay? Or whatever it is nowadays. Don't judge me based on my generation. Don't confuse me with millennials. They invented something called ghosting. Has anyone heard of ghosting? Yeah? When you text someone and you decide to cut contact with them forever, you just sort of pretend they never existed. Someone once ghosted me and I ended up crying myself to sleep every night for nine days straight. I couldn't deal with it. I kept ringing home asking my nan, Nan, do you think anybody wants me? She said, course they do love. How do you explain millennial dating to older generations? Okay, imagine you went for dinner with your partner and halfway through the meal, you both decided to break up permanently, alright? Then you finish the rest of your meal together alone, but pretending you hate each other. Eventually the waiter comes round and asks for your dessert preferences. One person says ice cream, the other person says pie. But neither of you eat either. Just sit there staring at each other in silence until eventually you pay separately and leave the restaurant. All because you didn't want to share a plate of profiteroles. Imagine sharing profiteroles with an ex-boyfriend? Horrors. My friend broke up with his girlfriend last year and he rang me afterwards, distraught. Told me he wanted to kill himself. I told him, mate, chillax, relax, calm down, calm down. Jesus loves everybody. Put the gun away. The police won't understand the intricacies of Tinder relationships. There'll always be another boyfriend. Have you ever tried online dating? Do you know what online dating is? It's where grown adults swipe left or right across their phones in order to find a soulmate. Somebody once swiped too far to the left and accidentally killed themselves. Swiping too far to the left. Can you believe it? Swiping too far to the right kills birds. In between, however, lies true love. Who knew? Anyway, I haven't found mine yet. The problem with online dating is you meet lots of jerks along the way. This guy messaged me on Tinder and asked me if I liked being raped. Raped. R-A-P-E-D. Not raped, but definitely open-minded, thanks. Another jerk wrote, Hey babe, hey babe, guess what? Guess what? My favourite position is doggy style. Doggy style. Doggy style. Well, we could start there. Or maybe somewhere else entirely. Why not try sitting down first, darling? You look nervous. Why don't we try kneeling? Are you sure you want to talk about sex? Sex is everywhere, innit? Even children learn about it at school now. Kids get taught stuff about biology and science lessons, even learning about human reproduction. Which is great. Except for the fact that kids are taught about human reproduction through a cartoon bee flying around a flower. That's exactly what happens. A cartoon bee flies around a flower, gets pollinated by pollen and suddenly becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby. Yes, that's absolutely scientifically accurate. Yes, that's biologically correct. Of course, bees have nothing to do with making babies whatsoever, but the teacher thinks it'll help them relate to the lesson better. But surely, if we teach children sexual education correctly, we'd educate boys properly on female anatomy, girls on male anatomy and vice versa. Boys, listen carefully. From the waist down, women have a hole in the front and a flap in the back. Flap goes forward, covers the hole, voila, vagina covered. Girls, listen carefully. From the waist down, men have a long thin dick. Dick dips in and out of vagina and you cum. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. It worked for my dad, it works for me. A couple years ago I came close to finding my perfect match. Her name was Emma. Emma was lovely. We spoke on WhatsApp for four hours non-stop. At one point during our conversation I realised that Emma lived literally ten minutes walking distance from my flat. Ten minutes! If I met her later tonight, tomorrow morning I could wake up next to a woman I genuinely fell in love with within seven months. Seven months! Because scientists say you need seven months to fall deeply in love with someone you barely know. Genuinely falling in love with someone you barely know. That's when they call it limerence. L-I-M-E-R-E-N-C-E. Limerence. Now pronounce it like you mean it, otherwise it sounds silly. Anyway, I walked her home, we kissed outside her house door and made plans to meet again soon. The day arrived, I waited nervously outside her office building waiting till she finished work. Finally she emerged, looked beautiful as usual and gave me a kiss hello. Afterwards we headed home, talked more, laughed more, felt ourselves getting closer and closer towards intimacy. Before long we stood facing each other naked side-by-side, ready to join body parts together forevermore. As I reached over to embrace her, I noticed that the top part of her body resembled that of a mannequin. A wax dummy wearing high heels and fishnets. Not my cup of tea, sorry. Still, I thought, perhaps we can change each other somehow. Maybe I can turn her into a real lady while she turns me into a real gentleman. Alas, she whispered a single sentence that shattered my dreams forever. Mum, you're welcome.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nSo I saw this text message that my dad had sent me.  I'm pretty sure he got it from his grandkids because no grown man sends a heart emoji to anyone ever  and then i said hey you know what's weird about your generation is how much they use these little symbols called emojies right like every time we go online  we see those things all over the place but i feel like our parents didn't really grow up with them so now when they do send us one it seems kind of out of character  but also if anything i think it makes their texts seem more sincere especially coming from dads because at least once per week i get some email from my dad where everything inside the subject line reads i love you too much son  right? He'll be like, yo, bro, can you stop texting me during work hours?  And then just below it, he has an arrow pointing down.  It's like, yeah, buddy! It's great!  But my favorite was when my mom sent me an email saying she was running late picking me up from JFK airport by half an hour.  She included three planes taking off into the sky.  Like, oh, shit, mommy's gonna miss her flight.  This isn't happening.\n\n## Transcript: got\nI'm from New York, so I was raised by my mother and father.\nMy dad's Puerto Rican, which means he has the temperament of a Latin lover combined with the patience of an Irishman who hasn't had his coffee.\nHe is very hot-tempered but never says anything to anyone ever because that would be rude. But it makes me crazy when people use the fucking smiley face emoji 😊 like what the fuck? Are you happy about something or no?\nBut here's the thing though, right? My parents actually met in Miami where they were both working as cocktail waitresses for Carnival Cruise Line. And if you're not familiar with this job description, essentially what these women do is get on board your ship and then serve you drinks while wearing a bikini.\nThey have been married now for over 25 years and I've always thought that their relationship seemed kind of like a cruise. It seems like fun at first until eventually you realize that there's nowhere to go and everyone looks exactly the same.\nAnd one time we went on a week-long vacation to Jamaica and my mom took her clothes off every day.\nI remember looking up at her and just going, huh? That doesn't look relaxing to me. She goes, oh, honey, relax. This is all part of the experience. I said, why don't you take your top off? She goes, I am taking my top off. Now let us enjoy ourselves.\nI'm not trying to say she's ugly or anything like that. It's just because there was no fucking way that I would ever be attracted to anybody with titties smaller than an iPhone 8 plus.\nAnd then she started doing tricks with them titties like they were magic, right? Like she was pulling fire out or some shit like that.\nSo now I'm thinking about what happened next because she's got some confidence, you know. And then I think maybe we should do it like this so everyone can see everything they're paying money to see. But I couldn't quite get into the spirit of things because there were two guys on either side of me who had their arms around each other but not really holding each other which made them seem less gay than regular straight men almost like they'd been given some kind of instruction no eye contact or kissing during the show they both looked out over the audience with an intensity i hadn't seen before until one caught his girlfriend's eye he winked once went back to staring at the woman across from him it was unsettling\nOh no! You're right. But what if she's one of those women who gets hornier when it's cooler outside? Do we want to risk our relationship with that woman? No thank you.\nOh man, she was right about one thing though! Relaxing does feel good when it's happening! But afterwards I'm like super stressed out because now I have two shirts on!\nAnd then she was like, well, what's wrong with this picture? Why do you want me to take my shirt off but not my bra? My response was simple. Because when a woman takes her shirt off and leaves on her bra, it looks sexual. When a man does it, he might have scurvy. Thank you so much! Have a great night!"
