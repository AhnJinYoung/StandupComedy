Roommates who label their food like it's a hostage situation, Don't eat my pizza...I mean, don't even think about eating my pizza. (pause) I'm not kidding, they put stickers on the containers with dates – like we're trying to solve a mystery together. The tuna was eaten between Tuesday at 6 PM and Wednesday at 10 AM by an unknown roommate. (laughter)  And then there's the labels that say things like 'not mine' or 'do not touch.' It's like, dude, if you didn't want me to eat it, why did you buy it?! Now I've got this leftover lasagna that says 'don't eat' on it. That just tells me one thing someone's really invested in being right about whose lasagna is whose.  But honestly, can you blame them? If I had to deal with people raiding my fridge all day, I'd be labeling everything too. Although now I have this great idea for a new business venture Labelled Leftovers Inc. We'll sell pre-labeled leftovers online and watch our customers' relationships crumble from afar! (applause)\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI've got this friend of mine, she's always like, oh my god guys I'm doing intermittent fasting right now you know what that means it means I only eat between midnight to noon and then I fast for all day tomorrow but it's not called fasting it's just called dieting because we're cunts that is correct call us out on our bullshit okay if someone was like yo fam i'm trying to lose weight you'd be like well why don't you stop eating? You can do anything, mate! That's so weird being an adult isn't it? Because when you were younger, you never thought about how much money things would cost or anything like that. But as soon as you become aware that there's money involved in everything, it kind of ruins everything forever. Like, growing up, we used to love getting McDonald's at lunch time after school. And every single kid wanted one with eight nuggets and large fries and milkshake and they'd want two straws and share them together no matter where they came from in life you could be gay black chinese white everyone was cool united until something changed along the way some point maybe around their early twenties maybe late teens people started becoming snobs over stuff yeah like i think the main culprit behind that is tinder actually man because uh dating apps have made everybody super picky over certain foods yeah especially fruit really yeah even worse than meat you'll find yourself swiping through these profiles you might come across somebody they say they like pineapple on pizza and you're straight away like nah thank you alright get the f*** out of here. Yeah, I mean, fair play, though, dude. If anyone ever tried to put pineapple on my pizza, I'd definitely end their life. It makes sense, doesn't it? Like, we hate pineapples on pizzas, but we love ham hocks on pizzas. What's going on with those toppings, bruv? Alright, see you later! God bless you! See you later! Bye-bye! But also, imagine having sex with somebody, and halfway through, they go, oopsie-daisy, by the way, I forgot to tell you I ate Chinese last night. Oh my gosh, sorry, babe. Yeah, I had stir-fry and rice. No, I didn't use chopsticks. It hurt my wrist too much. Do you want me to start again? Sorry, darling. Oh, um... Is that a bit cold down there? Okay, bye. No, listen, I'm vegan, but he thinks I ate chicken. If you're looking for new recipes online, check out vegan websites, and look into plant-based diets. When I first moved into my flat, I shared it with three other housemates, and none of them knew how to cook. And I said to myself, you know what, Mike? This will be a great opportunity to teach others how to cook and gain more friends, right? So, the next morning, I sent a WhatsApp group message saying, hey guys, let's make pancakes today. Who wants to join in? The response wasn't exactly what I expected. One guy replied back saying, I don't need any fancy ingredients like eggs, flour and sugar. I've already got mayonnaise in the fridge. What else am I missing? Another person responded by saying, no thanks, I prefer crisps. Then another reply comes back. He says, excuse me guys, I'm allergic to most types of bread including pancake mix. So therefore I won't be able to partake in today's culinary activities. Now, before I continue talking, I must explain that all four individuals live together in the same property. All right, so I took it upon myself to educate each of them further and decided to write out individual labels explaining which meals belonged to whom. Just to clarify, Mike eats the spicy vegetable curry while Chris has the roast beef sandwich. Dante does not touch the cheese board. Kev please keep your hands off my vegetarian quiche. Mike no longer lives with his old housemates anymore because he left to pursue better things. He's living in New York City. Thank you very much, enjoy the rest of your evening. Take care. Have fun. Thank you. Cheers!\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI used to live with two guys that were just like eating buddies.  They would eat everything together. They'd go out to lunch together every day, come back and watch TV, you know?  And I'm not saying they're gay or anything because, um... You see? Because it's weird if you put your arm around me now, so...  But when we lived there, it was always, hey! What do you want for dinner tonight, bro? And they had this rule where any time one person cooked something, they got to write their name on the side of the fridge what they made.  So then whoever goes to heat up whatever is left over later can tell whose leftovers those are.  It sounds simple enough but these dudes took it way too far.  Like my roommate Mike would cook some chicken breasts he would write mchickenbreast on his handwriting i don't even know how he knew  and then my other roommate steve he wasn't good at spelling either he would be cooking beef stew and then he would write s-beefstew on the side of the fridge  you ever notice when people aren't great spellers their misspellings get more creative though right yeah they start doing crazy stuff  i mean why would anybody take the time to add an extra letter into the word stew anyway  he could've been lazy and done better than that if he wanted to like instead of writing sbeefstew he should have written stew  but nope that guy went all in didn't care he wrote double-e-f-stew  That's not necessary dude!  If somebody comes along three weeks from today and sees SBEFFSTEW on the fridge, they're gonna think Steve's dead.\n\n## Transcript: got\nI live with two guys, right? And one of them's an asshole because he labels everything that he cooks or buys with his name on it so I don't eat it like this is how you know someone doesn't want to be friends with you when they're labeling their shit all the time.\nLike last week we had our first roommate meeting where we were supposed to talk about boundaries but really what happened was my roommate Brian just yelled at me for eating his hummus.\nI wasn't even hungry. He brought home this giant container of hummus from Whole Foods, which is disgusting. You can get better stuff at Costco.\nBut apparently it didn't make him feel good enough to go back there, so he bought another tub. Then he wrote HUMMUS IN THE FRIDGE in Sharpie across the top.\nAnd then he left town before anyone else got home, hoping that no one would find out.\nSo I walk into the apartment after work, see this huge red warning label staring me down. Like, oh shit, who did that? Probably not gonna eat that now.\n Now, here's the thing though. We have a very open relationship. If something belongs to somebody specifically, they write their fucking name in big letters across the front.\n If something belongs to everybody, nobody writes anything.\nSo if nothing belonged to anybody, why does it say BRIAN'S HUMMUS IN BIG LETTERS ACROSS THE FRONT OF THIS CONTAINER THAT BELONGS TO EVERYBODY?\nSo... It says that because he wants it to belong only to himself.\n This guy has such a bad case of ownership issues.\n Well, he gets up real early every morning and goes running around Lake Michigan by himself as well.\n But anyway, I'm telling people like, hey man, your friend Steve, he should do CrossFit. They'll tell me yeah, dude, he loves doing crossfit. That's why he calls himself meathead."
