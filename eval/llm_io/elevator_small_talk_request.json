It's like we're all trapped together, but nobody wants to actually talk to each other – until someone presses the wrong floor button.  Hi, how's it going? Oh great. We don't even need to say that anymore; just nodding is fine. Like we're at some kind of awkward silent dance competition.  And then there's the person who says, 'We're almost there!' while standing on my side, completely blocking me from moving. I'm not sure if they think I have teleportation powers or something.  But you know what's funnier still? When people try to break the ice with their kid. Look, honey! A new friend! No, buddy, this guy's been stuck in this metal box for three minutes too; he doesn't want to be friends either. Just let him enjoy his personal space... which is roughly two square feet right now. (pause) That's why I love elevator conversations so much. They're basically free therapy sessions where everyone gets annoyed by themselves afterwards.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI was on an office building today, right? I'm going up to my floor. The guy pressed his button first so he's like hello how you doing thanks good just got back from holiday yeah i said what where did you go he went south of france lovely place yeah i thought it was gonna be one of them places that you don't know but instead this man knew exactly which part uh we're talking about here now there is more than two parts down there mate you've been everywhere haven't you? What were you doing out there? You weren't working or anything, no? No work at all? Nope! Just enjoying myself. Oh well, enjoy yourself while you can because when the government takes away our pensions, then who knows? My boyfriend lives in London. He works for HMRC. Anyone heard of him? Yeah, they love taxman, don't they? He hates it. And every time I see some guy with a suit on telling me how much money I owe... Ooh! But anyway, if anyone tells you that Britain needs immigrants, tell them to get their own cleaning lady. That'll sort them out. And before any white people complain, yes, black people clean houses too, okay? It doesn't have to be black women. Black men do housework as well. We do everything else, why not cleaning? Oh, another thing happened in that lift. Another person came into the lift, had a little look around, looked confused, didn't really say anything until the end when she said... Excuse me, excuse me! Is anybody here British? Because I want somebody English speaking. Because I think I need help. We need to talk to someone whose language we understand. It's very interesting isn't it though because sometimes even within countries there are different languages spoken um i feel sorry for those people actually especially the elderly ones cos they're getting older every day without learning new technology they won't adapt they won't change right oh i forgot my pin number again it's the same reason why they keep putting pennies under my pillow after midnight because they forget what century they live in and they still believe in fairies, don't they? Do you ever hear that joke? Do you know the old Irish joke? Well, if I told you I'd have to kill you. So thank you guys very much, take care bye-bye\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI don't like it when people ask me where I'm from.  It's not that they always get it wrong  it is but i just think there's an assumption behind the question right if someone asks you where your from oh man i can tell by your accent well this guy looks like he was born yesterday so let's see what happens here  there's kind of a hierarchy to these questions too yeah uh huh right (Settup) If someone asks you where you're from first off why do you care?  But then depending on how old you look compared to the person asking the question it could be either really flattering or really embarrassing, right? Yeah.  For example, if somebody younger than me asked me where I am from, I'd probably feel good about myself, because at least my face doesn't give away any information, right? Like, if I walk into a room with some young hipster who's wearing glasses, skinny jeans, Converse shoes, and a scarf around his neck, and he goes, hey dude, where are you from? And I go, I'm from Canada, bro, he'll know exactly what I mean.  Like, we've got mountains, hockey rinks, moose, polar bears... You wouldn't even need more than one word!  And I would take pride knowing that I pulled the wool over his eyes, you know?  He thought he had me cornered with those fancy pants and the hairnet, didn't he? Didn't work, did it? No way! Gotcha! Haha ha ha ha ha! Yeah, nice try, kid.  Now, on the other hand, if someone older than me were to ask me where I'm from, you know, say like a grandma or something, that's different story altogether, all right?  Then I might start getting a little defensive, maybe even lie to her, which isn't very Canadian of me at all, actually.  That's usually our biggest mistake as Canadians down south, is lying about being American, because apparently nobody believes us.  They never buy it. They're always like, no, buddy, come out now, you liar.  So, instead, I started doing this thing called the Canadian Accent Switcheroo.  Yeah, basically, whenever anyone under the age of 40 asks me where I'm from, I switch accents. From a moment's notice. It's amazing.  From Canuck to Cockney in two seconds flat, baby.  No problem. Not easy, though.  Not everyone has it in them. All right? So if you want to master this technique yourself, here's what you gotta do.  First, you gotta relax your tongue, put your mouth together like a fish.  Secondly, tighten up your vocal cords.  Third, pretend you're trying to pull the tag off a t-shirt.  Fourth, make sure your nose hairs aren't touching your upper lip anymore.  And fifth, remember to breathe.  All right? That last part is crucial.\n\n## Transcript: got\nI'm actually really bad at small talk, but that's okay because there is no worse place to be forced into small talk than an elevator with one other person who has their back turned away from you like they're staring right through you and then suddenly turns around and says hello what do you do? And now it's my turn! What am I going to say?! How about this? This is my answer every time! What do I do? Nothing else matters when you have nothing to do. You got to own the moment. Just look them dead in the eyes and go... Absolutely f***ing everything!\nI've been doing comedy since before phones were smart.\nBefore social media was big enough for me to complain about.\nComedy central would often put up new comics and I'd see these kids coming out here fresh-faced naive excited to get on TV you know and some nights they would kill oh man you guys had so much talent i remember laughing so hard thinking wow this kid could make it you can't even imagine how good they are and then two months later they just disappear forever and all we're left wondering is why did you try?\nI was like, what happened? Where's my next big break? And now Comedy Central has an app where you can go online and watch all of those old shows from the past.\nAnd my friends were like, well, maybe he was gay.\nI'm starting to think if you got booked on Comedy Central, there was like an ancient curse placed upon them where every six years around Halloween time, one of those fucking demons from hell comes down and drags him away.\n(in a mock interview voice) Oh boy, here we come again! Well, welcome to another episode of What Happened To That Comic? We're joined tonight by our returning guest, Mr. Nick Kroll!\nI can't believe you guys didn't recognize me because now my hair is shorter than it was on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon.\n Now I feel comfortable telling people in real life that I do comedy.\n I've been doing it since college.\n And like any other time you start shit or get into anything creative when you're young, there's always somebody who tries to steer you away from pursuing what they think is not viable because of the odds against success."
