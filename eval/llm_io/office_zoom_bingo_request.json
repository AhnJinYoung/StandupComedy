Office Bingo. (pauses) I mean, who comes up with this stuff? 'Get five people on screen at once.' That's not a game; that's just my family dinner.  But seriously though, have you ever noticed how everyone gets so invested in their bingo cards during those virtual team-building sessions? It's like we're all competing to see who can spot the most unmuted cat or poorly lit kitchen counter.   And don't even get me started on the squares – 'Someone says synergy without using it correctly', 'A manager uses Comic Sans for the first time'... These aren't games of chance; these are social commentary!  I'm pretty sure if they added 'The CEO falls asleep mid-meeting' square, I'd be winning every single time.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI'm so glad to be back doing live shows, because Zoom is fun but it does have its downsides. One of them being you can't really do any drinking on Zoom, right? Because if I was at this venue now, that would just be part of my job, yeah? Just got to get hammered every night, innit? But not when I'm on Zoom, no. If anything happens while we're on there, what's going to happen? That's all I've thought about today. Like, what if someone comes through the window? What am I supposed to do? Call security like, hey man, help! Someone's coming into my house! They'll be like, whoa, hang tight sir. Where are you located again? That guy in the background shouting out, put him on speakerphone! Put him on speakerphone! So... Yeah... No one wants to see me naked. That'd ruin their day, wouldn't it? My face pops up, everyone goes, oh no. Not another one. It doesn't matter where I am or how far away from home I am. When people think of England they still go, London. Everyone thinks of England, London. And even then some people say Manchester, which pisses us off, obviously. We know it exists though, thank you very much. No one gives Birmingham an honourable mention for whatever reason. Even people in Wales don't give it a shout-out. People always talk about the two cities, right? London, New York City. The rest of the world seems to love comparing those two places together. They seem to want to compare the two cultures side by side. New Yorkers will often complain about how crazy our transport system is over there. And we might hear that sometimes. Just ignore them, mate. Don't let them wind you up. Cos deep down inside, everyone knows it could never actually work properly. Can you imagine trying to run the tube during rush hour with American efficiency? Imagine hearing announcements come over saying things like, ladies and gentlemen, good morning, welcome aboard. Please make sure your doors open and close completely before boarding the train safely behind me. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome aboard. Please mind the gap between yourself and the stranger sitting next to you. Mind the gap between yourself and the stranger sitting next to you. Ladies and gentleman, please keep your arms inside the carriage at all times. Thank you so much. Have a great journey ahead of you. Hello, hello. How are you guys feeling after last week? Very excited for tonight. I feel fantastic. Excellent energy in the room already. Great to see everybody smiling and enjoying themselves. Somebody told me recently he had seen my name written on something called Office Bingo Card. Apparently Office Bingo Cards were popular online during lockdown, especially during video conferences. Yes, apparently these cards feature phrases commonly used in virtual meetings such as nice to meet you and that kind of thing. Any idea why anyone would create such a card? Why anyone would use such a product? Well, I think it's probably safe to assume most users aren't looking forward to attending these conference calls. Maybe they find it boring listening to other people drone on and on. Or maybe they hate meeting new colleagues and dread having to chat to them afterwards. Whatever their reasons may be, they've created Office Bingo, hoping to liven things up slightly, right? By marking down each time they heard certain catchphrases, until eventually somebody said something outrageous enough to win them the game. Sounds exciting, isn't it? Now, if only life wasn't quite so dull. Office Bingo sounds perfect for office workers stuck working from home. Couldn't agree more. Here's a phrase, ladies and gentlemen, if you ever need one, a little something i came up with myself specifically designed for office zoom bingo. I present to you ladies and gentlemen, bottom half of the screen, top half of the call. That should be enough to get you started on your way to winning big. Hope you enjoyed it. Cheers, thanks very much.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI got this card from my friend who's an artist.  She made it herself because she was bored at work during lockdown when we were all doing Zoom meetings.  And I think that's really funny if you're sitting there thinking about how much effort went into making one piece of paper look like another.  But then she sent me these cards to play Bingo with her online while we both worked remotely.  And so now every day before our meeting starts, I print out a new sheet.  It looks different every time. You know? Like today, just three boxes going horizontal.  Like what is happening here?  What kind of person comes up with this shit?  But... My favorite part is actually the terms and conditions on the back.  They say things like, do not use your camera or microphone unless absolutely necessary.  Oh! That sounds very strict.  Do not be late to the game.  If someone uses their camera or mic without permission, shout no!  That feels very passive aggressive doesn't it  and finally if anyone says the phrase i'm sorry again they lose two points but get double points for saying sorry not later  i thought oh yeah well why would anybody ever want to win at anything anyway right  but I've learned a lot since playing this game.  A few things I didn't realize.  One thing I didn't realise until recently is that men can multitask too.  Right, people always assume women cannot multitask.  I used to believe that myself.  Then I saw a man send a text message on his phone while he was being interviewed live on TV for a job as head chef at a children's hospital.  He did that twice before giving up and getting fired.  So uh maybe don't tell him that.  Also, some guys will turn off their cameras during virtual meetups even though they haven't been asked to.  Just disappear completely behind a wall of silence.  Don't take it personally, ladies.  Men often go missing mid-conversation in real life too.  We'll talk to them for years.  Next thing you know, gone forever.\n\n## Transcript: got\nSettled into my new job, I'm starting to get comfortable again with Zoom meetings now that we're allowed back out of our houses but you know it's different when you work from home right because you don't have any boundaries like I used to go to work every day put on my suit pretend to be an adult person leave all my problems there come home drink wine watch Netflix eat cheese before bed sleep do it again next morning wake up feel good about myself continue living life well-adjusted adult human being then COVID hit and I went straight back to college student mode where I would roll out of bed jump onto my laptop start typing away in pajamas without brushing my teeth eating cereal or something while I worked just treating it very much like an exam paper except I was doing nothing productive whatsoever so they introduced this thing called office Zoom Bingo which is if someone does one of these things during the meeting you mark them off on your card and whoever gets the most wins prizes now yeah I thought that sounded great oh man was I wrong uh what happened guys was everyone became absolute lunatics okay and no one even cares anymore either like remember how we were trying to save lives you remember how serious people were remember how strict everything got remember how many jobs disappeared overnight all those bakers all the bartenders oh we gotta shut down bars and restaurants cause i can't breathe and black lives matter you remember that stuff yeah dude i forgot already too didn't care enough to write it down anyway that doesn't even matter let me tell you why guys it doesn't matter why I think nobody cared because they kept putting the same link everywhere and eventually everybody stopped opening their emails and checking their calendars and reminders and notifications and text messages because you'd open anything that had more than two words in it and it'd always say join zoon line number five um please join us online at zoom.com slash dash button dash three for the weekly team huddle all right cool thanks bye love you guys see you soon um whatever i mean i guess technically zoom dot com forward slash dash button dash three is correct but they never included the dashes in the email so i've been clicking random numbers together for months thinking i missed some important meeting and then finally i clicked four zero nine six two two eight seven three four and i saw a picture of a penis and i almost died wow thank god it wasn't another pointless PowerPoint presentation okay but it did make me realize how bad I am at math okay because whenever I tried to figure out who sent that dick pic I couldn't do it alright maybe it was a coworker maybe\nI started getting really paranoid because I knew none of my coworkers could send dick pics because none of them have dicks okay I also know for sure because I sit directly across from each other in the middle row on a Tuesday afternoon when Jack walked by he tripped over his own feet and fell face first into his monitor and I saw his full unobstructed body including his full unobstructed genitals and I remember looking at him after he jumped up rubbing his eyes like this going, hey, bro, you okay? And he goes, ugh! Just... Ugh! Why won't you die?! Uh, yes, exactly. No penises here. We only have penises on Fridays at lunchtime, and not even everyone has those. Thank you.\n Now it's become way harder to keep track of whose turn it is because we haven't done Friday lunches since March, which means all the dudes that aren't gay or Jewish, or both, have gotten lazy and have stopped tracking it themselves.\n So instead, they'll walk around the office sometimes randomly pointing at a guy crossing his arms like, Hey, you owe $6.50 to the penis trust fund. Or else they might point to somebody sitting at their desk like, Oh shit, Mike owes $6.70 to the penis trust fund. And I'll look at him like, I literally just asked you to help me finish this report last Thursday! Like, what is happening?\n I still work at an investment bank as well. Okay, they will ask you questions though during interviews that seem completely unrelated to the role itself, but they actually relate pretty strongly. One question they often ask is, how do you handle ambiguity?\n They give you examples, like, imagine you buy tickets to Disneyland on Black Friday. You wait outside overnight, and then you rush inside when doors open early in the morning. But once you get through security, you find out that Space Mountain is closed due to technical difficulties. What do you do? Well, I wouldn't fly across the country for Disney World, obviously, but...\n But basically, what I usually answer is, I'd call customer service and complain until they fix it, which is kind of true, but what they want you to say is you learn to adapt. So I should say, I take advantage of the situation. Instead of waiting hours in line for Space Mountain, I try to convince the people behind me to switch places with me so I can skip ahead and ride Pirates of the Caribbean twice consecutively.\n Yeah, that happens quite frequently at work. There's one specific group within the company that I deal with fairly regularly, and anytime we talk, it becomes incredibly awkward. It's mostly because they speak exclusively in buzzwords and corporate jargon. If I ever bring something up that's relevant to what we're talking about, they immediately interrupt me with something equally irrelevant.\n-  One time I brought up employee retention strategies, and they interrupted me saying, you gotta crush KPIs. Crush them. Get those numbers.\n And I said, I agree wholeheartedly, but I think you're missing a big part of the puzzle, because employees need intrinsic motivation to perform well, whereas companies use extrinsic motivators like money and bonuses, which ultimately leads to burnout.\n He interrupts me mid-sentence and says, well, it seems like you're stuck between Scylla and Charybdis. He spelled Sylla and Charibdiss correctly, but Charidbis has an extra d and S. That's embarrassing.\n That sounds terrible. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\n So he interrupts me mid-sentence and says, well, it seems like you're stuck between scylla and charybdas. Yes, he spelled syllabus and charadebass correctly. And then he continues on to say, I believe that's ancient Greek for being between a rock and hard place.\n  Like, what is happening? The best part is I learned later on he was dead wrong. Ancient Greek for stuck between a rock and hard place is actually charambas, pronounced Shar-em-bus.\n Now, that makes sense. Because if anyone knows about rocks and hard places, it's Heraclitus."
