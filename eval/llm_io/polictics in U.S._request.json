We're like that one couple who can't agree on anything – except for the fact we both hate each other. (pause) That's basically Congress.  I love how politicians say'my fellow Americans' before saying something ridiculous. Like, no, dude, I'm not your fellow American until you tell me my healthcare is free. Then maybe we'll be buddies!  And have you noticed how every politician claims to want change but still wears a suit from last century? It's like they're trying to make us believe, This guy has been around since Reagan! He must be honest!  We complain about our government being divided, yet we put them all together in Washington D.C., expecting some kind of miracle. Newsflash it's called compromise, folks. But don't worry; if you're an extremist, there are plenty of jobs available... at Fox or CNN. Pick your poison!  But seriously though, have you seen those town hall meetings where everyone gets loud? Sounds exactly like family gatherings during holidays. Same principle applies – just louder, with more anger. And less turkey.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI'm from Texas, so you know that's not true. But I'll tell you what is true about me. This is my first time doing this show where I've never done one before. And it's terrifying because like every other comic on stage right now has been around for years and they're good at their job but i haven't even started mine yet which means everything can go wrong tonight all of these jokes could bomb if there was an actual bomb here then things would get really interesting real quick huh real quick yeah yeah okay um i don't have any bombs so no thank you guys keep trying to make us laugh uh i won't be making anyone laugh unfortunately i think the biggest issue we face today though is politics man it gets crazy sometimes honestly just talking about politics makes me feel like two old people arguing over whose turn it is to use the walker do you mean to say that our president isn't cool he doesn't walk with his cane? You want to call him granny? Listen up! What were you saying earlier? Oh, you got something smart to say? Well, well, well! Look who thinks they're gonna talk down to me! Okay, fine, Granny. Have it your way. But when I see a Mexican guy driving a Chevy truck... Hey, hey, hey! He ain't Mexican, boy! That's American car culture! Oh, oh, oh, come on now, look how white your knuckles are getting. All right, let's try again. All right, listen up, everybody. Let's start fresh. We love our country. Who loves America? Everybody! Okay. Now... Nope, still too much hate coming out of you. I need somebody with less attitude issues than both of y'all combined. Somebody who hasn't realized that neither side wins arguments, only bystanders win arguments. Alright? So stop fighting. It's kind of hard to take sides nowadays, especially after seeing some of those political ads. What's going through their heads while creating them? Like, I saw one recently featuring Joe Biden, and the narrator said, quote, Joe Biden wants more taxes for Social Security. Now, why would they ever put that line in the ad? They should have instead gone with something more accurate, such as, quote, Joe Biden believes everyone deserves access to healthcare. Or better yet, quote, Joe Biden thinks Medicare should cover dental work. That'd be more relatable. We can relate to that. We can also understand that's impossible. This next bit goes back to my hometown of Houston, Texas. It starts off simple enough. So basically, whenever I used to hang out with friends growing up, we always had to decide whether or not to wear deodorant in the summer months. And usually, depending on outside temperatures, we wouldn't bother wearing antiperspirants during warmer weather. The reason being is we didn't sweat that bad until the late spring and early fall seasons. During those times, we could finally apply regular ol' soap once more without feeling like we smelt like a stink bomb went off inside of ourselves. However, we did find out firsthand last year during Hurricane Harvey that having body odor wasn't the least of our concerns regarding personal hygiene. Like, remember how that storm flooded almost half of Houston, causing thousands upon thousands of homes to flood? Well, imagine living in one of those houses. Imagine waking up, thinking you smell pretty terrible already due to not showering since Saturday night. Then suddenly hearing news reports stating that the water levels aren't receding fast enough. And by evening hours, you realize you gotta evacuate soonest possible, and you only brought your toothbrush and hair gel with you. How refreshing does a nice cold shower sound right now? Just throw open those windows wide, baby girl! Feel the breeze blow away the funk. If anything else happens to us personally later in life, just remind yourselves that hurricanes will bring you closer together as family members. Remember how great it felt walking into grandma's house for Thanksgiving dinner knowing she washed her hands thoroughly beforehand? Not so funny anymore, eh? Also, please help families affected by natural disasters with donations. Thank you very much. My name is Kevin Nealon. Thank you.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI feel like I'm getting older too because now my friends think it's their job to tell me what music is good.  They're always trying to get me into new stuff that they think will change my life.  And every time, without fail, when they recommend something to me, there'll be some part of the song where it goes against everything I believe about humanity.  Like recently one friend was recommending this band called Tame Impala.  Now if you don't know anything about Tame Impala, just go ahead and imagine your least favorite millennial telling you that he found an old CD in his dad's closet from back before CDs were cool.  He brought it home. He put it in a computer. And somehow made himself sound better than Fleetwood Mac  That's basically how much more psychedelic Tame Impala sounds like it would be great with some sort of ritual sacrifice.  But nope! Just guitar solos as far out as the ears can hear!  So we're listening to this track. It gets to the point where Kevin Parker sings...  'It wasn't love at first sight.'  Oh, man... Oh, well... Yeah. Love sucks, I guess.  Then another song comes up. Now I really hate myself. Because now I realize I've been going through phases of being sad my whole entire life.\n\n## Transcript: got\nI think that if you're going to go into politics, like you've got to be prepared for all of this stuff. Like, I don't know how Donald Trump did it, because he's never had any experience or anything before, but he went through so much shit with his family business and then reality TV.\nAnd then he was just ready for president? Like, what happened there? Because no one else could have gone through everything that he went through during those two years and come out looking better on television than Hillary Clinton.\nLike she didn't even get her own scripted show! What is happening?! It bums me out though, because we need more women in power right now. And especially black people, because white dudes are getting too many opportunities, honestly.\nI want to see Oprah run. Or Beyonce. Any woman who has been an executive producer on their shows should definitely run for office.\nWomen running for office makes sense to me because they tend to focus on issues that really matter.\nBecause when men talk about policy, they always sound like a bunch of boys arguing over which Pokémon would win in a fight.\nI was watching my friends have an argument on Facebook recently because I'm addicted to Facebook.\nI'm sorry. Because when you look at politics, it's all just like, nope, Pikachu wouldn't do shit to Mewtwo.\nI think it's because we've all been raised on the same thing since childhood.\nLike I grew up watching Dragon Ball Z with my friends every day after school.\nI think it's because we've never had to make decisions based on our own reproductive health.\nOh my God! Because I'm not going to lie fellas... When women argue about politics we do it completely differently than you guys because when men talk about policy they always sound like a bunch of boys arguing over who'd win in a fight.\nThey're all just doing it because someone dared them to.\nOh my god! You guys ever notice how whenever you ask politicians what their stance is on an issue? It's always so stupidly specific!"
