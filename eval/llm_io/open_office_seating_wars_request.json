The way people become territorial over their desks, like they're guarding a prized possession. (pause) I mean, have you ever walked by someone who's trying to 'claim' an empty desk with their laptop and coffee cup? It's like they're saying, 'Back off, this is my turf.'  And then there's the seating arrangement – it's all about strategy. You've got the power brokers sitting near the CEO, the introverts huddled in the corner, and the social butterflies vying for spots at the watercooler. (laughter)  I saw a guy the other day who put up a little sign on his cube that said, 'Do not sit.' Like he was a king or something! And another one who brought in a plant to make their space more... inviting. (chuckles)  It's funny because when we were kids, our parents used to tell us to share our toys. Now we're adults and we can't even give up our spot at the conference table without getting anxious.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nThere's something that I don't know if you guys have ever experienced, but we've been doing this for years now. If you're not familiar with it, basically what happens is every couple of months or so an office will decide to switch from cubicles back over to open office space where everybody sits at desks next to each other. And they think that makes them innovative geniuses because they get to call it an open layout. They always say like, oh yeah, our company has gone completely open floor plan. We just kind of let all these employees roam free wherever they want on campus without any walls around their workstations or anything crazy like that. It sounds very liberal progressive except when you walk into one of those offices and there isn't even a woman sitting down behind a desk anywhere. So who exactly do you need to keep track of? The intern? They should be going home by lunchtime anyway. He could probably figure out how to use his laptop without breaking it. I'm telling you right now, ladies, I got news for you. When the men are done using their laptops, they'll go ahead and put them away real quick, but then they still got some time left before they start drinking again. So while no women are looking, what they tend to do is sneak off to a corner somewhere and jack off. That's why they make us leave early. Because they can hear my voice coming through the wall. So they send me packing at three o'clock in the afternoon. But I tell you what, though, after they kick me out, about two hours later... ...there's only one person left working late in the entire building. The CEO. And he hasn't showered since Friday night. Yeah! Thank you. Yes! I love seeing young couples come together and realize that sex is actually fun. This particular couple was adorable. She had glasses, she wore her hair up, looked cute little heels, and she went by Dr. He was much more laid back. He wore jeans and sneakers, looked relaxed, didn't wear a tie once during the whole conversation. Went by Dave. Very laid back guy named Dave. Very easy-going until he started talking about the business side of things. At which point he became super intense. Like, talk about passive-aggressive. She said, hey, babe, what would happen financially if we were to break up? What would that look like? What would that mean? He goes, well, first of all, I hope nobody breaks up with anybody else. Cause if somebody does break up with somebody else, I'd definitely fuck that bitch up. Oh, okay, good answer. Then he paused for a second. Oh wait, am I allowed to say that? Is that cool? Is that fine? Am I supposed to be saying that? Well, thank God I asked. Thank God I asked. All right, let's try that again. Here we go. Breakup. Okay. Okay, breakup. Breakups. All right, financials. Financially speaking, if we broke up, I guess I wouldn't really lose too much money because nothing major came out of our relationship. Nothing big happened between us financially. Which made sense considering she's a doctor and I sell insurance for dogs. We're never gonna buy a house together, obviously. Or maybe eventually. Maybe someday. Maybe, hopefully, sooner rather than later. Thanks for the vote of confidence. Just kidding, thanks for being such a great sport. Have a nice day. Bye-bye. Yes. No, seriously, I appreciate it. I see people laughing. I understand that sometimes jokes aren't funny anymore. Sometimes we live in different times, circumstances change, and jokes become outdated. Somebody recently told me, they go, man, that joke doesn't seem funny anymore because we got rid of the N-word. No shit! We did! Now you gotta listen to rap music! Come on, man! Listen to rap. Give me another chance, bro. I promise you. Guys, give him another shot. Don't worry, man. I feel bad for rappers. Rap artists used to have a lot of creative freedom. Do whatever they wanted on records. Those days are long gone now. These labels dictate everything. Remember old school hip-hop albums? They'd literally just release albums straight to CD without editing a single thing. Not anymore. Everything gets edited now. Even Kendrick Lamar releases songs. Every song starts off seven minutes long. By the end of the edit process, it comes down to four minutes. How many beats did y'all throw away today, sir? Sir, how many bars did y'all cut from this album today? Four. How many fucking bars? Whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down, motherfucker. My name's K Dot, remember? Kendrick Mother Fucking Lamer. Alright, alright, alright. Let's take a breath, brother. Take a deep breath. Hey, yo, I'm sorry about earlier. I'm sorry about earlier, man. It wasn't personal. Yo, man, I'm trying to find myself. I'm trying to stay true to art form. I ain't making no commercial hits. I'm not putting no platinum plaques on the fridge. I'm making real hip hop, baby boy. Real street, real authentic, real honest-to-God hip hop. I'm pouring my heart and soul onto wax. Cuz that's the way hip hop works, man. It's real simple stuff. One minute you're hot, next minute you're not. Next minute you're dead. Look at Tupac Shakur, man. Tupac died 20 years ago, yet we still celebrate him every year. Why? Why do we still pay tribute to Biggie Smalls? For Christ's sake, we called him Biggie Smalls. Biggie smalldicks. Wow. He was huge. That's why they called him Biggie Smalldick. B-I-double-gie-smalldick-alright. His dick was small. Ladies, gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Mr. Jay-Z. Hello, New York City. This is DJ Kool Herc. Everybody knows who I am already, but I might as well introduce myself. DJ Kool Herc, founder of modern-day hip-hop music itself. Nobody knew about hip-hop till I invented turntable scratching and locking the beat. Right here in the South Bronx, Queensbridge Project, New York City. Ain't nobody touching this. Locking the beat means that I took both platters, turned the volume down, and kept rocking nonstop. Rocking forever till the wheels fall off. Hoo-ah, hoo-ha, hoohahaha, hoo-ho-ho-ha-ha. Whooo-whooo-whoooo-oopity-doo-waa-waaa-wawawa-pat-a-cake-mama-papa-pop-like-an-instrument-you-can't-touch-this-hey-yo-my-name-is-jay-z-and-i'm-from-the-bronx-where-kids-play-with-xenon-lights-but-it-sounds-good-on-beats-by-the-pound-so-listen-up-as-we-get-started-talking-about-shit-that-happens-around-town-right-now.

Open office spaces where you sit at tables with other people who work there like it's a library study area but everyone wears suits  And I don't know if anyone here has been to one before they're kind of weird because every time we go into one we realize that no matter how much money your company makes nobody actually works anymore right?  It's just people sitting around eating cereal looking at their phones scrolling through Twitter waiting for something interesting enough to happen so they can write another blog post about it  We were all trying to get rid of our cubicles and then someone realized why do we need rooms alone to think when we could share them with six other people?  So now instead of having a room to myself, I'm sharing this table with three other guys. One is snoring very loudly, which is annoying.  The others won't wake him up even though he's sleeping with his mouth open.  That was my first thought when I saw him sleep. That was my initial reaction.  Because I've never met anybody whose face looks exactly like their body.  What's going on? Is that what happens if you eat too many sandwiches as a child?  Is that how nature dries up your personality?  Just like everything else.  He fell asleep while playing solitaire.  All of us at different times fall asleep doing things we didn't mean to be doing for long periods of time.  Like you'll watch an hour-long show thinking two minutes will pass watching it and nothing more than that will ever come from it.  But sometimes you might accidentally read Wikipedia pages on topics you had absolutely no interest in until you started reading those pages.  Did you know that sea otters hold hands together in groups at night to keep themselves warm?  They're not able to generate heat internally so without these little human-like chains they'd freeze to death.  Now imagine being part of one of those chains. Just clinging to some stranger like the only thing keeping me alive is his cold clammy hand squeezing mine tight.  Every morning you look over and say good morning buddy hope you slept well and he wakes up says yes same to you Jimmy i guess yeah maybe a little bit wet from last night's group hug  i did not expect that but anyway moving on uh so there was four of us seated in front of the man snoring  and one of the guys next to me starts talking about whether or not his computer monitor should be horizontal or vertical.  And I want to address this question directly because as somebody who doesn't care either way, I feel like I deserve the answer to both questions.  In short, horizontal. Because there's less screen real estate lost that way.  When you make it vertical, half of the screen goes unused.  There's a lot of wasted pixels staring back at you, begging you to use them for something fun and entertaining.  Instead, you turn your whole desktop sideways, wasting an entire quadrant of content on the internet.  Or maybe you turn your laptop upside down and hit print on that report due tomorrow at noon.  You gotta be careful, man. You gotta stay sharp.  Don't let technology lull you into complacency, okay?  Vertical monitors waste space vertically.  Horizontal ones save space horizontally.  And if you really wanted to maximize your productivity, put your phone on its side.  If you put your phone on its side, there's more stuff above the keyboard and below it.  More text messages! More emails!  Yes! And... No. Yes!\n\n## Transcript: got\nEach side, of course, has its own argument about why they're right to do what they're doing.\nThe open office fans will tell you that it fosters collaboration and creativity among coworkers by allowing them to work together in close proximity with one another.\nThey'll also remind you that the word office literally means a place where people who don't like each other go. So there's some science behind this shit.\nAnd then, of course, we have the haters, which include myself because I've never met anyone who liked an open office more than me when I was trying to take a nap at my desk at noon every day. But even those haters would argue, all right? Even us haters would say that if we were going to try something new like open offices again, here's how we'd fix it. We'd make sure everyone had their own private space or cubicle or whatever you want to call it, but just give them their own room so no one can bother you. And if you didn't know someone else is bothering you based solely off of sound alone, come up with a noise-cancelling headset for free. That's not too much to ask. You could charge $50 bucks for it. It wouldn't be weird. If anything, the person wearing headphones in public should get paid extra money as well. They shouldn't only listen to music while walking around outside either.\nAnd if you didn't know someone else is bothering you based solely off of sound alone, come up with a noise-cancelling headset for free.

They shouldn't only listen to music while walking around outside either. What kind of sick bitch does that? No! Maybe you catch the bus early enough before rush hour starts to put on your favorite podcast. Or maybe you got up way earlier than any normal human being should ever wake up from sleep, and now you enjoy listening to audio books. Whatever the case may be, you deserve a bonus, man. A little extra scratch in your pocket for blocking out the rest of society during your daily commute. Right? Give it to him.\n Now you might think, okay, fine. Bonus for the guy rocking his Beats By Dre in the park. Yeah, yeah. There's always gonna be exceptions to these rules. People wear headsets everywhere for legitimate reasons. Like I said, podcasts, audiobooks. Sometimes they play video games when they walk home late at night after working double shifts. But let's face facts fellas. Most guys rockin' headphones in public aren't listening to Jack Reacher. Right?\n Let's face facts, fellas. Most guys rockin' headphones in public ain't listening to Jack Reacher. Hell, half the time when you see somebody walking down the street jamming out to their iPod, they probably lost both of their parents in Hurricane Katrina. Then they went through the whole ordeal of living in a FEMA trailer without a roof over their heads and now they can't help but hum their least favorite Katy Perry song whenever it rains. Just saying.\n Oh boy, oh boy. Okay, look, let me start this off by saying that I'm originally from Los Angeles, California, which is great. Thank you very much. Great city, beautiful weather year round, wonderful beaches, amazing restaurants. Everything I need to live happily ever after for the rest of my life except for one thing traffic. God damn it. Man. I hate traffic in LA more than I love sunshine. Which doesn't mean a lot because I absolutely adore sunshine. But traffic is ridiculous.\n My friends back East complain about potholes and shoveling snow. I'm like, hey dude, drive three miles south and experience paradise. Traffic sucks, man. Not only does it suck for me personally, driving around LA getting honked at, almost hitting pedestrians, and losing my mind every single day. But it really hurts the economy as well, according to studies done recently. Because if you spend more than two hours stuck in traffic per week, chances are good that you won't feel motivated to buy stuff later in the evening when you finally arrive at your destination. Got to prioritize self-care first, baby. Prioritize yourself. Get yourself a bowl of ramen noodles. Watch Game of Thrones reruns until midnight.\n In fact, according to this study, women actually tend to shop more often than men, especially if they ride the train into Manhattan during peak hours. But I guess if you add up all the minutes spent commuting across America for both sexes combined, men still end up buying less crap overall because we refuse to stop moving forward towards our goals unless absolutely necessary. We don't believe in taking naps mid-afternoon.\n Look, obviously, uh... We're not lazy, ladies. Obviously. I wasn't born yesterday. All right. Listen, we all agree that feminism is important. Yes. Please clap along, sisters. Equality for all genders. Absolutely.\n  However, I am starting to notice lately that sometimes, you know, dudes in feminist spaces will talk about feminism using terms that seem perfectly harmless to them, but somehow misogynistic to everybody else. For example, you know how white people will use phrases like racial reconciliation, racial healing, reparations for slavery, voting rights act, black lives matter? Never once heard a male feminist say that. Only females talking about feminism. Men rarely discuss gender equality amongst themselves, unfortunately. When I bring this topic up with fellow dudes, I hear responses such as, oh, bro, we gotta support sisterhood, you know? You gotta lift her up. She's carrying the load. Women's rights are human rights. Don't shoot the messenger."
