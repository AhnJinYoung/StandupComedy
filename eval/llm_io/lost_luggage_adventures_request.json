When you're on vacation, excited to explore new places... but first, you gotta play 'find my suitcase'. (pauses for laughter) I mean, it's like that game where you have to find yourself after college.  I was at the airport once; my bag didn't show up until two days later – with a note saying they'd given me someone else's clothes by mistake! It had a wedding dress inside. Now I'm thinking about this person who wore last night's party outfit on their honeymoon day. That's some real-life rom-com stuff right there!  And then there's when airlines tell us our bags will be delivered within an hour. You wait three hours, start checking social media... meanwhile, mine is probably chillin' somewhere, getting free massages from airport staff. They've got priority parking, food vouchers... and we get nothing except it'll arrive soon – which means never.   We need an app just for tracking missing suitcases. Like Uber or Lyft, but instead of cars, it shows all these random people walking around airports carrying other peoples' bags. Title would be 'LugHub' 'Where did my shirt go?' 'Hmm, let me check LugHub.'\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI hate flying, you know what I mean? Like, don't get me wrong, I love to travel. That's really cool. But it always seems like when we're getting ready to fly, something bad is gonna happen with my bags, right? You know how that goes around. So before every flight now, just for good luck, I do this thing where I put my bag on the carousel at security so they can see it there but then take off running through security like an idiot until I'm out of sight from them. And then by the time I come back and the conveyor belt has turned all the way around again, hopefully mine will be sitting next to yours, okay? That happened once. It was amazing. We were both doing the same thing. And he looked up at me and said, oh shit! What did you... what did you think? But no one else ever does it, which makes me look crazy. No matter who boards the plane first after us, none of these other people seem to care about their bags whatsoever! They walk down the aisle without looking or even glancing over at our bag twice. We've been married for seven years and had two kids together. This guy walks past our baby stroller three times without picking it up. It's unbelievable. The worst part is though is when you check a piece of luggage because if anything happens to that it costs money to replace everything inside it and yet airlines still make you go through airport security to pick it up afterwards. How much sense does that make? If TSA agents have already gone through it once why would anyone need to touch another agent today? Why not skip that step altogether and let everyone board the plane immediately upon arrival? Instead of waiting outside behind those yellow doors for ten minutes staring at some old man who's also been waiting too long. What kind of airline would do such a thing? Oh wait, almost any one of them. Right away. There used to be this lady working at Delta whose job was to call me personally whenever she found my missing suitcase anywhere within the entire airport. And yes, she literally called me directly on her cell phone while walking across concourse B. Because apparently she didn't want to disturb anybody else either. She'd say stuff like, hello Mr., please hold for a moment. Okay, thank you very much sir. Hi ma'am, may I speak with someone? Hello, hi, well, hello, um, excuse me, ma'am, could I talk to somebody? Hi, yeah, hey, hi, hi. Thank you. Thank you. Well, hello, hi, uh... Thank you. Hello, hi. Is that Mrs.? Ma'am, is this Mrs. Smith speaking? Yeah, hi, hi. Ma'am, sorry to bother you, but I am calling regarding the black suitcase tagged number C-7 that belongs to Mrs. Smith. Uh-huh. Yes, I understand you checked it last night. Yes, exactly, and uh... No, ma'am, nothing's coming out of that compartment. Well, anyway, just thought I should give you a heads up, alright? Thanks. All right. Bye-bye. Bye bye byebye. Byebidu du du. Bibbidi bobbidi boo.

And I had this really gnarly adventure with my luggage because it got left behind by American Airlines in Chicago O'Hare airport.  Yeah! Yeah! And you know how that works? Because they're always like, we'll get your bags to you as soon as possible!  It's not even their fault. It wasn't anyone at American Airline's fault. There were three people who messed up my bag getting home.  First person was me when I went through security because I didn't check all of my electronics into one bin so half them came out here and then  second guy was an agent named Bob who took his break during my flight time which is why he gave himself only six minutes to get everything ready before boarding started  and third person was another man working for american airlines name steve steves job was supposed to be watching over my bag while bob did those things but instead what happened is after i put my suitcase down he picked it up and walked away with it  i'm talking about steve here guys. This has been steve's whole entire set right now. Just walking around doing nothing.  So I get there, no problem. I go straight to baggage claim, find my bag, pull it off, start putting shit back inside.  That's when I realized two things simultaneously. First thing I realize is I don't remember packing these shoes.  Which means I forgot to take them off when I checked my bag. That's number one. Number two, where's my backpack?  I think someone stole my backpack. So panic mode hits, call the airline, explain what happened.  They send somebody from the ground crew out to search for it. She finds it immediately, brings it back, apologizes profusely.  Everything's good. Now let's do our final scan. We're gonna make sure everything else matches up.  Nope, something missing again. Call the airline once more. They can't help us anymore. Send a supervisor out.  He comes out and he says, well, sometimes if a piece of equipment malfunctions, we might lose some stuff along the way.  If I may suggest, sir, please come with me. You've already missed your plane.  But I want to give you $200 worth of travel vouchers. Have dinner on us tonight.  How does that sound? Well, thank you very much, Mr. Supervisor. Thank you.  What would happen next is I'd buy myself dinner. Then I'd use the rest of those dollars to pay for UberEats.  Now, I thought this whole night couldn't possibly end worse than it already had.  Then the driver arrived, opens the trunk, puts both of our suitcases in there, slams it shut.  We jump in, drive five miles north. He turns around. I'm looking at him going, hey buddy, we gotta go south.  This isn't happening. Why aren't we going south?\n\n## Transcript: got\nI was flying to New York last year, I had two pieces of checked baggage with me because my mother doesn't like it when I wear new clothes so she sends them ahead with me just in case something terrible happens.\nI got off the plane and went straight through customs onto the train that takes you from JFK airport into Manhattan where I live. So now we're on this train which is a long journey by the way this thing goes forever if you've never been before take some aspirin or something but anyway we're going along And then there's an announcement over the intercom saying would anyone who has left their bags unattended please come forward immediately\nWe don't know what happened they could have gone missing on one of those flights right oh i'm about to tell you all a very scary story actually i'm quite calm aren't i um nope no i mean apart from the fact that obviously these were brand new designer shoes\nBut yes so we get off the train go down to the area where our bags should be and guess what? Our bag hadn't arrived either!\nSo, after a while, we find out why neither piece of luggage came. They'd both been put on the wrong flight!\nSo I can see as people hear that I'll start getting nervous cos everyone likes hearing how your stuff hasn't turned up not mine yeah well I feel bad for the poor guy sitting here thinking he's gonna kill tonight well you won't be killing anything mate no thank you.\n-  But anyway we ring American Airlines and apparently they say they will send someone around to collect us, pick us up, drive us back to LaGuardia Airport and fly us home again free of charge!\nAnd then I thought about it and i went oh no you've got me there because if they come round my house now i'm gonna kill them\nWe got there about an hour later, turned out it was just some guy who had been waiting all day outside JFK airport.\nI thought I was having a good day until my dad rang me an hour later going oh by the way he's not coming.\nWell, great! We're going home on holiday without spending any money whatsoever.\n We did end up buying food though and we ended up staying another week so everything worked out alright really.\n Oh god no no no no it didn't work out okay because I only told her half the truth so I said look mum honestly I forgot my passport at home I think it must still be downstairs.\n She says no it definitely isn't that suitcase has already landed so I say oh no maybe it fell behind the radiator or something.\n No she says I've looked everywhere. So eventually I had to call Dad, give him permission to go upstairs and steal my bloody passport!\n He stole it under false pretences, but I couldn't blame him, because I wouldn't want to pay airfare every time my son forgets his bloody passport!\n- (In Setup) Then we land in America and there's another problem so this particular airline does not allow passengers to board planes unless they have printed confirmation of their booking.\nSo basically even though I've paid £600 for my ticket they refuse to let me on the plane because I haven't brought the actual paper proof of purchase."
