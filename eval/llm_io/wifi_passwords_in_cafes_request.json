They always have these super-long, nonsensical WiFi password requirements – like they're trying to filter out anyone who doesn't own a dictionary. Welcome_to_Our_Independent_Coffee_Shop or something like that.  And then you see people just typing away, like they're solving world hunger instead of getting their coffee. I'm pretty sure my grandma could crack those codes if she had an iPhone. It's like, 'Grandma, can you figure this out?' And she'd be all, 'What's a QR code?'  I swear, some places put so many numbers in there; it's like they want us to get lost forever on Google Translate, thinking we need a degree in cryptography just to order a latte online. Can someone please make a password generator for coffee shops? Like, generate me something easy... maybe 'coffee' would do? That way, everyone wins!\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nOne thing that I do quite often when I'm on my laptop is go to a cafe, right? Now, if you've ever been into one of these places before, it's like walking through an airport security checkpoint, isn't it? Because they're always asking for information. They don't care about what you want to buy from them anymore. They just really care who you're going to tell. I have got no idea why we still call them Wi-Fi because every time you connect now to public networks, there's some kind of warning message coming up saying things like, this network may be unsecured or not secure at all. And yet whenever I get to any place where they've put out their own special little box with their WiFi password written on it next to it, I think to myself, surely that's even less secure than anything else i could pick off the internet. That can only belong to that particular company, so they must know exactly how many people will use it by the end of today. So therefore, you should assume everybody knows already. But what I usually find is I'll try and read whatever password they've come up with. It might say something like 'WELCOME TO THE COFFEE SHOP'. My initial thought then would probably be well done guys very original I didn't see that coming but unfortunately most times I also look around me and realise nobody has bothered reading theirs either. What they tend to do instead is take the first letter off each word and join those letters together. So they'd end up with W-T-C-S, which sounds pretty safe to me. The problem is though sometimes there's more words involved in there than four, right? Like, let's imagine our coffee shop here had decided to write their password as follows welcome to the best independent coffee shop in town. If someone were to take the first letter off each individual word in there, they'd end up with w-t-b-i-c-s-i-t. Thank you. Thank you so much!\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nMy name is Neil. I live alone with my dog.  I'm not gonna say his name because he's asleep right now so that would be weird  but thank you very much everybody this is great to be here it's good to see some people who don't look like they work at a call center which is always nice  i just got back from ireland i was there for two weeks had an amazing time went to galway kinsale cork all the places man  galway has one of those little harbour streets where everyone wears a jumper even though it's summer it's lovely  if anyone hasn't been if you haven't been before when you get off your flight going to irish airport uh they've written out instructions about how to speak to them while you're over there really sweet  like no using colloquialisms such as yeah fair play but also we love tourists so feel free to use american phrases like hi buddy hope you having a good day dude it'll make us laugh  and then halfway down the page it goes please do not use the phrase top banjo okay obviously not funny to the locals anyway um  my favourite thing about being away from home is getting access to other countries' Wi-Fi networks mainly because none of ours work  that's what keeps me up at night mate thinking oh i could turn myself into a human router  all these devices connected to my body hotspots popping off everywhere i'd never leave the house again  so when i go abroad anywhere outside europe i love looking at their WiFi network names usually made by baristas and stuff  anyone else remember when coffee shops first started putting their own wireless internet in bars were one of the first places to put it in  it wasn't long after the invention of coffee itself actually when did humans decide they needed caffeine?  just wandering around the savannah drinking blood? What happened next?  No, seriously, someone explain it to me.  But if you're familiar with UK-based Costa Coffee chain, they used to have a password called 'letthemhaves'. Any fans of Glee among us today?  The term let them haves comes from Shakespearean English meaning give me more.  And I think that's quite ironic coming from costa coffee seeing as every single branch closed during lockdown due to covid-19  That said guys whenever i travel outside the uk i just find the wi-fi network names hilarious especially ones created by americans honestly so cute and naive  the best one i saw recently was called i believe in jesus christ that's pretty standard american fare  they're very open about religious beliefs aren't they didn't know if anybody knew this but apparently americans will write anything online without consequence  this guy lives in new york city probably works on wall street and yet still feels comfortable sharing his personal beliefs with strangers  he might as well have left a comment below saying something along the lines of I am a boy God bless America huh\n\n## Transcript: got\nI'm on my phone, trying to get online so that I can check what time it is or send an email back home because I'll be away from Wi-Fi for like two weeks, but you know how it goes.\nSetup So there's always this moment where you're sitting down with all of your belongings around you and then someone walks by and they say something like 'Hey buddy do you have the password for the Wi-Fi?'\nSetup And immediately without thinking about it i just go oh no absolutely i don't want you to use my internet\nI feel like if we had free healthcare, our politicians would actually care.\nBecause right now politicians only really give a shit when people vote them out office which means their entire campaign was based on lies.\n But here's the thing, here's why I think Bernie Sanders might win.\n Here's why I think Bernie Sanders might win, he doesn't talk like other politicians.\n He talks like regular people speak to each other.\n Like when he came out during his last election saying things like Medicare For All, Free College Tuition.\n A lot of young white women were like, I hate Bernie! He wants to make college free!\n I was like, yeah, and that way you wouldn't owe $100,000 dollars after graduation.\n If Bernie gets elected, I'm going to vote again.\nThe reason I haven't voted before is because I've been living outside of America for over six years.\n It turns out you need to live inside of America to be able to vote."
