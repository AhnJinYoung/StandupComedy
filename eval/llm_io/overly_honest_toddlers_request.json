Toddlers who tell it like it is, right from day one. I mean, my niece was two years old once, she looked at me and said, 'That shirt stinks.' (pause) That's not even an opinion; that's just fact.  I've got another friend whose kid told her husband, 'Dad farted.' Now, I'm no expert on toddler etiquette, but isn't there some sort of rule about keeping that kind of information private?  And have you ever noticed how kids will give their parents unsolicited advice when they're eating dinner? Like, my sister-in-law's daughter comes over to them, looks down at their plate, and says, 'Grandma needs more vegetables.'  But honestly, if someone asked me for life advice now – I'd say be honest with yourself, don't wear socks with sandals... unless you want people laughing behind your back.  (cue laughter and applause)\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nOh my god, guys, you're going to love this story I'm about to tell because it's all about one of our favorite people on earth children! And specifically tiny little tiny little three year olds who say shit that we can't believe they said but also kind of makes sense if you think about it right like what do kids know let them talk i want them to talk oh man oh man am i gonna be so glad when he talks for real yeah i mean not really no thank you um yes i would just never hear end okay uh-huh well then you'd have two conversations at once which is fun and exhausting and weird and cool um very excited to meet him though um super stoked i actually had a conversation with his teacher recently she was telling me about some new things that he could do now that he's bigger than a baby like you know like roll over or grab toys off the ground and stuff like that and she told me something amazing that she's been noticing with her students lately where the way they communicate has changed and now instead of crying to express their feelings these little three-year-olds will speak up honestly uh they don't hold back anymore and there's a lot less sugarcoating coming from their mouths now that they've figured out how to use words and i couldn't agree more you know i feel like when my nephew cries sometimes i wish someone would come by and shake him good for saying what needs to be said you know like shut up buddy what's wrong daddy did it again why didn't you just cry already kid you were supposed to keep quiet you made promises to yourself you weren't going to say anything else besides those cute little coos coo-coo, coo-coo! But nope, babies are gone, bye-bye! Now we got three-year-old boys running around speaking truth to power, huh? And you might wonder, does anyone ever get mad? Is anybody upset about this change? Like, parents getting angry at teachers? You betcha! Teachers definitely hate being confronted with reality while trying to teach phonics. This woman wrote me an email after talking to her, just complaining about how much trouble this child was giving her. She mentioned several times during the course of the letter that her son is only four years old and therefore too young to understand sarcasm yet still proceeds to treat every question asked to him like a fucking riddle. She writes, quote, when I ask him questions such as whose shirt is this? He responds with comments like it doesn't matter. Like, holy crap, what kind of dark magic are you using on this poor boy? Because that is exactly what he says. It doesn't matter. My heart went out to her. But then I read further into the email, and towards the bottom, she mentions another student named Max. Quote, max responded similarly to yours truly yesterday morning. When I asked him who knocked over his juice box, he simply looked at me and replied, the devil. The devil! Oh, sir! That's insane. Did you write this last week or today? Are you having fun doing improv at home? This guy nailed it! The devil! No idea how he knew, but he absolutely knows. I thought maybe I should try to help him out somehow. Maybe give the mother some suggestions on parenting strategies. Maybe she wants some advice. So I sent her an email back. And I started out nice. Very polite. Quote, hi, thanks for writing. Sorry to hear you're dealing with the whole honesty thing. Unquote. Then I got pretty snarky. Pretty quick. Unquote, haha, just kidding, bitch, that's hilarious. That happened to us all the time growing up except everybody lied except me everyone lies nobody likes hearing the truth not even adults especially not when it comes to food. No one tells you how disgusting certain foods taste until you eat them. They lie through omission. There's always so many omissions involved whenever grown-ups discuss adult beverages. Have you noticed that when somebody asks you whether you drink wine or beer, you'll immediately respond with whatever's safer-sounding option available? Even if you prefer the other, you'll pick safe money, safest sounding option. Even if you prefer the other, you'll choose the safest sounding option available, usually whichever costs more. It sounds counterintuitive. Why wouldn't you go for cheaper booze? Why do you care? Because most of the time, people asking aren't looking to learn anything about the type of alcohol you enjoy drinking. Most of the time, they're just curious about whether or not you drink at all. They're worried you're judging them based on what you consume. Not enough. You need to chillax. Don't worry, I won't judge you based on what you're putting away tonight. So you reply safely, sure, I have a glass of wine every night. Or beer. Beer every day. Every day, same as water. Same amount, same everything. Yeah. I drank a bunch before work this morning. My boss hates me. Drank a ton. Then if you press any harder, they become incredibly defensive about their choice, almost as if you attacked them personally. How dare you suggest such a thing? Wine is clearly superior to beer. What kind of monster thinks otherwise? Have you tried wine at all? If you haven't, listen, trust me on this one. It's worth learning how to pronounce. If you ever encounter somebody who prefers cheap beer to fine wine, avoid engaging with them altogether. Don't bother wasting your breath on educating them. Just walk away slowly. Trust me, save yourself the headache. Or better yet, wait till next Tuesday. I promise you, I guarantee it, hands down without fail, if you bring a case of craft IPA to your friend Steve's barbecue next Tuesday, he will turn on you hard. He will flip sides faster than a politician caught taking bribes. Harder than Kanye West flipping between genres. Steve loves IPAs. Love, love, loves them. Can't get enough. Doesn't care about anything else. Only cares about IPAs. When you show up with IPAs, Steve becomes obsessed with IPAs. All he wants to talk about is IPAs. Will trade you his girlfriend for an IPA, literally. Doesn't matter that you brought six different varieties, including the double dry hopped imperial IPA. None of that matters. All he sees is a big ol' bucket full of his beloveds, and suddenly the world revolves around hops alone. Start calling him Hoppy McHopface. Call him Hops. Hoppy Hophead. Anything related to hop culture. Everything else fades away, and nothing else exists outside of the pale ale universe. Forget sports teams. Forget politics. Forget wars overseas. Who gives a fuck? IPAs make life worthwhile. Suddenly you're part of his inner circle. Suddenly you're invited to all sorts of exclusive hop-based events. Invite-only keggers hosted by breweries. Private tours of the brewhouse led solely by Steve himself. In fact, when he takes you behind closed doors, you start to realize he works there. Yep. Your dude Steve works directly for Sierra Nevada, overseeing quality control themselves. Now it's just you and Steve inside, walking amongst giant steel tanks filled with bubbling yeast, surrounded by piping hot mash tuns covered in foam. There's no sign of the rest of the brewery staff anywhere. Just you and Steve in heaven together, sipping samples straight from the source itself, sharing notes on bitterness levels. Hopping into action, swapping stories about cascades, centennials, saaz. Yes, saas. One of his favorites, apparently. Can't believe how lucky you feel to have found such a true partner in crime. Someone who shares your values and tastes buds alike. You look forward to attending all future beer tastings, knowing he'll be leading you through each flight. Each time, he introduces beers like they're newborn puppies. Oh, here's our first pup of the evening. His name is Pilsner. Isn't he adorable? Give him a belly rub, see how sweet he is. Oh, and watch this. Take a sniff... See how beautiful he smells? Yeah, you can smell it. Yeah, I put that special ingredient myself. Well, it turns out Steve's obsession isn't quite unique to just IPAs either. Turns out he's crazy about all craft beer in general.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nMy little boy is almost three years old.  And he's one of those kids who just tells you exactly what he thinks at any given moment without ever stopping to think how that might make other people feel.  So my wife and I will be talking about politics while we're watching the news with our son, and then all of a sudden he'll chime up out of nowhere like this.  That means you hate Mexicans!  We were getting ready for bed tonight and he said something else really amazing.  He was sitting there waiting for us to put him down, so his eyes got very sleepy-looking.  But they wouldn't stay closed because he kept looking over at me and going, look! Look! Daddy has poopypants!  I'm like, it's not a big deal yet. It's fine. Don't worry about it. He's still small enough where it doesn't matter.  Then when he was two, I remember being downstairs doing dishes.  He comes running into the kitchen holding his belly saying, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mom\n\n## Transcript: got\nSet up A toddler was saying to his mom, I'm really sorry about my dad's dick.\nIntrigue Because he is jerking off too much right now.\nAnd then she goes back like this with her hand like oh yeah, keep doing it daddy. It's so good.\nAnd they're married? That'd be weird.\n But I don't know why you would think it wouldn't work out because if anything having kids makes your marriage better.\n You want more sex after you have children. What happened there is what happened here.\n Because when you first get together as young adults, you make love all night long every single night for years, right?\n And then eventually one day you go, eh, fuck it. We can just do this quick thing.\n Now you got two people who used to run around naked chasing each other through the house. The only time we see them both naked again is the same place we saw them first.\nNow you've been together eight months or whatever, you walk into the bedroom where you had your first kiss, and guess what, there's another person in bed.\n(Intrigue) Oh! You turn on the light. There's an alien baby sucking its thumb.\n Where did it come from?\n So you start fucking him like twice a week? Yeah, okay.\nI got pregnant. And then he left me for my cousin.\nAnd then he gets so mad because I'm not making eye contact with his dick. Like it's just rude."
