The meetings that have no agenda, but somehow they're still going on for an hour. It's like my grandma's gossip sessions – 'I'm just calling to say hello.' But it turns out you've been talking for three hours.  Or how about when someone says, 'We'll be right with you,' and then I spend the next five minutes watching them scroll through their emails while we wait?  And don't even get me started on virtual happy hours that start at 5 PM and turn into 10 PM. Who knew having drinks together over video could lead to so much small talk?  (Pause)  I swear, some people think Zoom is code for 'we need to catch up' or something. Newsflash if we really needed to catch up, we'd schedule a face-to-face meeting... or send each other actual letters.  (Applause)\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI hate Zoom meetings, man. I just do. They make me so tense up before every meeting. And then they always go on forever because people don't know how to get off of them for some reason. Like you're not allowed to hang out after school anymore or something like it's crazy. The worst is when there's only one person left who hasn't said anything yet but nobody wants to let him talk i'm sorry what was the question again um yeah no i mean uh oh my god yeah thank you guys so much like why did we even schedule this call if everybody already knows everything? Is anybody else sick of these endless zooms? Like you've seen those movies where someone gets trapped in a room with an insane killer? You gotta wait till he falls asleep at night. We should all be waiting until the host loses their internet connection. That'd work too good actually. They got rid of open offices now, which makes sense, right? Because people can't focus when other people walk by. But sometimes during the day, especially around lunchtime, people will come into our rooms, break down the walls, and say stuff like, hey, team, has anyone tried any new restaurants lately? Or, what kind of wine do you prefer? What kind of wine do you prefer? Are you dry? Or sweet? It's interesting that you ask because recently I became aware that red wine is made from grapes while white wine is made from ice cubes. Yes, that is correct. And we think of ice cube trays as disposable products, but really they could last us many years if we reuse them responsibly. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. That'll help cut back on waste. Do you want more questions later on today about sustainability issues affecting the planet earth, such as plastic bags versus paper bags or straws made of metal versus straws made of glass?\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nYeah! I'm not gonna be your Zoom friend.  I had my first one recently when we were allowed to leave our houses again after lockdown number two.  And it was so good catching up with all these friends that I'd missed because they're far away from me now due to moving abroad to live their best lives without me.  But you know what? We got through those difficult times together via technology. And then there's this one particular friend who she is very nice but she wanted us to do another thing called a coffee date  and I just hate doing these coffee dates like i think if someone wants to see me they can meet me out socially let them buy me an overpriced cup of coffee and give me some change back than don't need to talk about stuff over zoom um  so anyway she sent me her email address which has been around since the dawn of time and I knew exactly how long it would take before she asked to call at least half an hour right?  So I prepared myself by making myself look presentable while wearing no clothes.  That's how much I didn't want to get ready.  Right, I click join meeting. She clicks join meeting five seconds later.  She goes, oh hi guys, thanks for joining. How are we feeling today?  We've both clicked off mute buttons as well. So we could hear ourselves breathe and pretend to say things we didn't actually mean to say.  Oh, I feel lovely, thank you for asking. Thank you. It's great being here with you guys.  Me too. Yeah, yeah, really enjoying the break from work as well.  Yeah, same here. Same here.  What line did you use to come into work today?  Uh... Why are we having small talk?  It's gone ten minutes already. What am I going to tell people I said during that conversation?  Like what do you think I should wear tomorrow? Should I go for bold colours or neutral tones?  Let's stop wasting everyone else's time.\n\n## Transcript: got\nI've been having this problem where I'm going to Zoom call after Zoom call, you know? And sometimes they just kind of bleed into each other, right?\nSetup The first one is like an hour long, then another one comes along three hours later, and it's like nine o'clock now, we're still on the third call.\nSetup It gets really weird because everyone knows how much time has passed by now but nobody wants to admit it out loud so instead what happens is people start making these very specific noises during meetings to let everybody else know when enough was enough.\nSetup You ever notice that? Like someone will be talking about tax returns or whatever, and suddenly there'll be a big fart sound coming from somewhere. Or somebody will get up and walk away and then come back with some snacks.\nSetup Now you have to wait two more minutes before you can leave. Because if you don't, the person who called the meeting might think that you left too early last week. That happened!\nI actually ended up leaving my job recently doing remote work. But not because of any noise issues.\nI quit over zoom because i kept getting distracted by the background pictures i had on my laptop screen okay yeah uh-huh every single day no matter whose virtual conference room i walked into i'd see this picture of me and my grandma holding catfish together which she got us both wearing matching cowboy hats while standing next to her trailer.\nIt wasn't even relevant to anything we were discussing. She would say stuff like, well, Bob, why do you keep telling our team to put their shirts back on?\nOr, hey, look again! This picture of yours reminds me that we need to go fishing soon!\nSo... Yeah, I couldn't take it anymore. Thank y'all so much.\nMy name is Sam. So I am probably pronouncing my name wrong for the rest of the show tonight. Most people pronounce it as SAM, like a boy's name. But technically, my family does pronounce it as Cam.\n Well, when you tell them your name is Cameron, they always ask follow-up questions like, oh, huh? Why did your parents spell Cameron without the R though?\n They usually say it with a tone of confusion, implying maybe I should sue my parents. Which sounds silly until they find out that my dad spelled his own name differently than my mom spelled hers.\n My dad spells it C-A-M-I-O-N. He's Italian-American. His father immigrated here from Italy. His mother grew up in New Orleans. Her whole side came down from Ireland. Then he marries a girl named Samantha O'Neil. She doesn't want to give up her Irish surname.\n And my grandpa didn't want to lose all those points he earned playing Gaelic football against England in front of his wife, so...\n Now you have to wait two more minutes before you can leave. Because if you don't, the person who called the meeting might think that you left too early last week. That happened!\n Yeah, I was working remotely with him full-time for five years, man. We were married for seven months, six days, four hours.\n-  We met online. It was a whirlwind romance. We broke up. I moved home. I started applying to jobs around town.\n-  When I told my friends that I was moving home permanently, they asked me a bunch of advice-y questions. One friend said, Hey, Sam, how do you plan on handling seeing your ex-boyfriend every single day?\n-  This is true story. What are you gonna do? Do you wanna change your daily routine? Are you gonna avoid certain areas?\n-  But honestly, I feel like I already handled it pretty good the last time. When I saw him walking towards me, I turned around quick and pretended to shit myself real bad. Worked perfect every single time!\n-  He starts yelling at me through the window because I'm supposed to pick up Chinese food from across the street. I thought you wanted General Tso chicken! Come on!\n-  And also, he used to talk about himself nonstop, you guys. Every single day. Just facts about himself that he felt important to share with me.\n-  Like, he once won a regional championship wrestling match. Did anybody hear that? Okay, cool. All right, yes, I heard that.\n-  That being said, it's worth noting that he lost to the same guy twice afterwards. Not bragging about it. Just stating fact.\n-  There was never a point in our relationship where I realized that I could stop listening to him speak altogether because I knew everything he had to say beforehand.\n-  Which means that anytime he tried to surprise me with new information, he inevitably caught himself mid-sentence going, Oh, um... Wait, you wouldn't know this, but...\n Because anyone who knows me personally knows exactly where I fall on that spectrum, and guess what? People aren't afraid to use it against me!"
