Unless you have health insurance that covers therapy sessions – then just go to therapy. (pause)  I was at my friend's wedding last week, and I saw an old high school photo of myself on their guestbook page. Let me tell you, it looked like I had been hit by a truck... or maybe two trucks. (chuckle) My hair was so big back then; I'm pretty sure I needed a ladder to get into our family car.  And don't even get me started on my dance moves. At this same wedding, someone asked if I wanted to take them out for some '90s trivia night drinks after dinner. When we got there, people thought I was there to DJ because everyone around us knew every song from the Spice Girls' discography better than anyone else at the table. Who needs talent when you can just memorize lyrics?   But seriously though, folks, being single has its perks – free Netflix passwords forever! (laugh) Just kidding; I think most exes would kill me for using those logins still.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI'm from LA originally, which is interesting because I look like this now. But growing up my parents were Mexican immigrants so they wanted to raise me in Spanish but at one point we just got lazy so instead of speaking English with them i would speak spanish to them but then switch to english when it was convenient for me. So if you ever want to hear that conversation play a game of catch me if you can with me. And sometimes what happens too is people will get confused about where my accent comes from or how do I sound American? Because on paper I don't make sense right? Like culturally I have no idea who Taylor Swift is, but grammatically I am correct every time. I feel like I should be teaching ESL somewhere, you know? But I think part of why I started doing accents though was to help hide my own voice. Like whenever I try to sing, I end up sounding like a bunch of dogs having sex together, honestly. It's very unsettling. My friends tell me, oh, Drew, you gotta work out more. You've been working out less than any other comic in the room tonight. Yeah, yeah. And I say, well, maybe if y'all stopped laughing all the time, I could afford to go back to CrossFit, okay? This isn't an excuse. It's not my fault that I'm only two-thirds muscle by volume. A lot of times I'll get mad at myself after shows like this. If the set doesn't land, I hate going home afterwards feeling sad about myself. What bothers me most, actually, is when somebody tells me after a show something along these lines... They're like, man, you really opened yourself up emotionally on stage. Thank you so much. Yeah, you guys really made me cry. Oh, thank God! Oh, I need that. Which makes me realize... I shouldn't open up on stage! No wonder nobody laughed during that last joke. I literally said, hey everybody, let's all hug each other. Let's become new besties. That is the dumbest shit I've ever said. Why did I do that? Every single person in this room has better things to do than watch some dude talk about himself before midnight. Don't clap for that nonsense. Now put those hands down. We are at capacity. The fire marshal told us to stop letting strangers touch one another. Stop touching. Not yet. Okay. Sorry. Hey, there's a couple dudes backstage. There's also a woman. She's fine looking. She looks good. She's hot. And she wants to come out. She's scared. She won't leave her dressing room. Do anybody want her to come out? Everybody in unison says yes. Great. Good to see that we still believe in love, huh? Everyone agrees. We're all horny losers. Even him over there. He thinks he hates dating apps, but deep inside he loves his phone more than anything else in life. We're all horned loser assholes. Anyway, she's coming out. Here she goes. Hi everyone. Welcome to This Is Not Happening. I'm your host, Roy Wood Jr., Comedy Central presents, This Is Not Happening. Each week on our podcast, This Is Not Happening, we dive into the lives of comedians, actors, musicians, writers, athletes, anyone who works hard enough to earn their living off their talent rather than their personality.

Howdy, everybody. Hello. Thanks for being here. Real quick, real quick. Before I start, real quick, I wanna give you guys a little taste of what's gonna happen later on tonight. Very quickly, without warning, just a little bit of improv, alright? On stage number three, please give it up for Jay Oakerson. Jay Oakerson, everybody. Hey, New York, what's happening, New York? Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. Y'all laughin' at me? Yo, I had a baby recently. I mean, yeah, it happened. Shit hit the fan. All right, that's cool. I saw a lady the other day. She looked like my wife. Looked exactly like my wife. I thought she was my wife for a second until I realized it wasn't. Then I felt bad, you understand? Cause you always wish someone else was dead. Bunch of weirdos in here tonight. Damn. You ain't never heard of me, motherfucker? Who the fuck are you? I grew up in a tough neighborhood called East New York, Brooklyn. East New York, that's hood-ass ghetto, nigga. Nigga, you wouldn't even take a shortcut through that shit. Just shoot me, doggie. Gotta keep walking. East New York, niggas sell crack out of the trunk of cars. Nigga, y'all got guns pointed at children. Hear shots ringing out. Nigga, kids playing outside. Parents yelling, hey, turn around. Go inside. Kids running away. Gunman pointing gun at kid. Kid run faster. Gunman shooting bullet at ground level. Bullet hits car tire. Tire blowout. Car crash. People jumping out of wrecked car screaming. Police sirens approaching. Get down. Asshole. White cops pulling up. Black ass police officers jump out. Nigger, drop your weapon. Pigs, pigs everywhere. I live in Fort Greene Park. Fort Greene Park, that's hipster heaven, bitch. Hipsters, they gentrify neighborhoods. Make everything safe for white people. Put up vintage street signs. Vintage street signs. White people walk under vintage street sign. Reads Niggress Avenue. Laughing. Hell yeah, bro. Take pictures. Text message it to friend. Dude, check out this black history monument. Send picture to Facebook profile picture frame. Frame reads, where I do it? Where I do it? Well, according to Google Maps, you do it on 123rd Street and Lenox Avenue Harlem, New York City. I went hiking once. Got lost in woods for seven hours straight. Seven goddamn hours. Guy found me crying. Found me sitting next to stream. Crying. He asked, yo, what happened? I said, nothing. He's like, nah, bro, there's blood all over your face. What the hell happened? I said, I fell into tree branches. He's like, you must be bleeding pretty badly. You might die soon. I didn't respond. Might die soon. Maybe I'll wake up tomorrow morning. Fuck you, dude. Whatever. I went rock climbing today. Sucks. Went skydiving yesterday. Felt great. I liked that. Ran into girl I used to date. Hadn't seen her since breakup six months ago. Six months later, same outfit. Same shirt, same shorts, different belt buckle. Different belt buckle. I was happy. I was like, wow, I guess she likes me, whatever. Turns out she bought new clothes six years ago. Didn't wash them. Kept wearing them dirty. Six months pass. Still hasn't washed them. Doesn't matter. I didn't care. I was just glad she came crawling back. Girlfriend broke up with me two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, she gave me the old ruse. Left town for vacation. I was like, ah, damn. Did she break up with me while I slept? Or did she sneak up behind me? Slap me in the mouth, kiss my forehead goodbye. Say, suck it, nigga. Tell your mama bye-bye, nigga. Call me when you find Jesus. Jesus, call me, nigga. I walked outside. Sun shining bright. Bird chirping. Clouds fluffy. Feeling peaceful. Thought to myself, what the fuck is wrong with women? Women act crazy. They freak out over stupid stuff. Ladies, calm down. Act normal. Love men again. Men love sane women. Men fall in love with nice girls. Nice girls get married. Happy marriage. Men marry nice girls. When I grow up, I hope to have a wife who acts reasonable. Reasonable. One guy asked me advice recently. He said, Roy, I'd like to ask you some questions. Could you answer them truthfully? Please ask me whatever you want to ask. Ask me anything. First question, you ever cheated on a girlfriend? Yes or no. Yes. Second question, ever lied about cheating? Yes or no. Yes. Third question, do you regret lying about cheating? Yes or no. Yes. Last question, do you think honesty is important in relationships? Yes or no. No. All right, thanks. Alright, everybody. Give it up for Roy Woods. Roy Woods, everybody. New York, New York.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI'm just getting older.  What's happening? I don't know what it is about being an adult that makes you realize how ridiculous everything is.  It was like when my dad told me to put on some lip balm because my lips were all dry.  And then he tried to kiss his granddaughter goodbye while wearing lip gloss.  That was crazy. That was insane.  My parents both wear hearing aids now so they're deaf as well  and i'll be walking down the hallway with them and there will be one other person in the house too maybe even two but only ever three people at any given time  i mean we could invite more if we really wanted to yeah yeah uh-huh nope let's do this yes ma'am thank you ma'am sir yes sir um excuse me miss sorry i didn't hear you say anything yet  so here's what happens every single day without fail  it's always the same thing it goes exactly like this.  The first guy walks into the room and talks and everyone hears him fine.  Then suddenly out of nowhere another person comes around the corner  my mom looks up from her book she says hello nobody else heard her till she yelled over everybody did that happen anybody else get caught off guard by that lady yelling?  Yeah, that happened.  So then she gets mad.  She yells across the entire apartment complex at the top of her lungs,  hey! You missed me!  Because apparently she thinks someone stole her moment in life.  This woman misses conversations.  We can't go anywhere together anymore.  We can't walk through public spaces without her breaking character.  Like yesterday we walked past a homeless man who had been dead for weeks.  She saw him lying there said hey buddy huh look at this poor guy right over here oh my god jesus christ he's sick that poor dude okay anyway let's keep going honey bye-bye see you later bye-bye you guys take care bye-bye goodnight sweetie love you bye-bye  No idea why i brought those lip balms back  we need these things  they're very important  but nothing irritates me quite like lip balm though  the worst part is that there's no warning before somebody shoves lip balm in your face  there's never a heads up there's no foreshadowing whatsoever it's just bang lips shut it's terrible  you should not shove lip balm in anyone's mouth unannounced  that would drive anybody nuts except for women because women already hate us for no reason.  They wake up in the morning looking beautiful.  When I woke up today, I looked like a raccoon trying to strangle himself.  All right, ladies, I think that's enough.\n\n## Transcript: got\nI was on the way to go to this job interview, right? And I got stuck behind one of those cars that just drives along with its hazard lights going off because it's broken down. And there were people trying to get past me like they're more important than everybody else or something. It wasn't even like rush hour either you know when nobody's in a hurry then you have all these entitled drivers who think their lives depend on them getting somewhere quickly i'm sorry excuse me thank you very much you can keep driving okay thanks so much bye yeah anyway uh-huh no seriously what kind of dickhead does that um oh but let me tell you how my day started alright before we go any further into this story um let me paint a picture about where I live in London if anyone doesn't know alright basically I live near Heathrow Airport now don't look up at me judging me like a little girl thinking I should be living anywhere other than around an airport because I work really hard to afford this lifestyle you know? So... I used to work in customer service which is why I'm always nice to everyone here tonight because I've been around enough drunk idiots to realise life's too short to give out abuse so carry on carrying on do whatever you want just leave me alone alright take care night see you later all right bye-bye well good evening everyone hi hello welcome to Comedy Central presents Kevin Duggan come on guys listen I'll tell you about my job as well I used to work in customer services now some of us know what that means if you didn't clap louder, I won't explain.\nOkay? Okay?\nSo, someone called me from South Africa today. Yeah, please laugh. You know what? To be fair to him, he did call me, so...\nBut she rang me, she phoned me from South Africa.\nAnd she goes, hello, may I speak to Mr. Douglas, please?\nI said, actually, my name is not Dougles. My real surname's Duggan, by the way.\nShe went, Oh, I am so terribly sorry! What is your first name?\n No problem at all, miss. But also, I couldn't help but notice that you had such a strong accent for a country located below the equator. Where exactly are you calling from?\n And she went, oh no, I must correct you, sir.\nI'm not fat. My body mass index is exactly what it says on my driving license.\nAnd then my date stood up, turned to me and said... Okay? You can't say that about Jewish people.\n She turns around and goes, hey, you seem quite confident talking to her. Why don't we try it and see how it goes?\n-  Now obviously I hadn't written anything down, right, because if somebody starts chatting me up in front of another person, especially after saying stuff earlier in conversation, right, I need to make sure I remember everything.\nSo I just go like, yeah, all right! But then my mum always used to say, never argue with someone who's buying you dinner.\nEven though she would have been happy to see me arguing.\nSo what I do is when he comes over, which by the way was lovely.\nRight? But what I did was I turned into the world's worst detective ever.\nSo I go, oh no, you're coming on too strong. And then I pull out my notebook from behind his back.\nIt's like Columbo, but instead of being old and drunk, it's just young and hungover.\n He looked at me like I'd gone mad. Like, what are you doing? Right? Then I turn back to him. I go, ah, yes, nothing. Just writing notes for a book I'm working on. Don't worry about it. Never mind. Thank you very much. All right?"
