You know what they say 'the third date is where things start getting real.' But honestly, it's usually around the second date that you find out if there's even hope for anything beyond Tinder.  I was at this coffee shop recently, trying to make small talk with someone who seemed genuinely interested... until she asked me about my cat. Not just any question, mind you – but one that started with do you have any pets? followed by an aggressive interrogation. Is he cute? Does he like treats? What's his name?  Now, I'm not saying I don't love animals; I do! In fact, I think cats rule the world right now (ask anyone whose house has ever been taken over). However, when your potential partner asks more questions than a journalist during Watergate, alarm bells should be ringing.  On another occasion, I met up with someone who claimed to enjoy hiking. Sounds great, right? That is, until we arrived at the park only to realize their idea of 'hiking' involved walking five feet uphill before proclaiming exhaustion and needing to sit down.  At least once a month, I hear from friends who're stuck on these awkward dates because they didn't Google their matches beforehand or just plain ignored red flags. It's time to take responsibility, guys!  All jokes aside though, dating can indeed be tough. There was one lady who ordered two extra shots after our drinks were served. Okay, maybe that isn't so strange. Yet then proceeded to drink them both while talking non-stop about her ex-boyfriend throughout dinner...  But hey, being single means still having room to grow – personally speaking, anyway. Or perhaps more accurately put plenty of practice material.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI'm on my phone all day, so I like to take time off from that when I go out with someone new. And sometimes it's hard for me not to check my phone because I don't know how much longer we're gonna be together. But if you ever try to hook up with somebody after one date, let this be an important lesson for you. Don't do it at their place! Don't! Because they'll have a bed. They will always, without fail, have a bed. And then there is no reason why you cannot get yourself home safely. So what am I doing? What am I thinking? Like I had sex with a guy once immediately following our very first meeting just because he had a futon. That was his pitch right away he did i need to tell you guys something about myself before i continue with this story okay uh i'm actually pretty picky when it comes to sex stuff like you might think based upon everything i've told you but yeah i am really picky when it comes to sex stuff now um i guess part of the reason i got down with him though is because he wasn't afraid to say anything. He didn't want any surprises later on down the road. When it came to the future of things, he laid everything out on the table. Which I appreciate. He said, well, I gotta warn you, I got two roommates living downstairs. They could potentially hear us having sex. And also, you should probably know that I'm going through some issues back East. It looks like I may end up moving back soon. Now, would you still like to keep going or... We went ahead with it anyway. We were both super into each other. It felt necessary. Here's the thing about being adventurous sexually, especially during the beginning stages of dating, is that you never quite know where you stand until it happens again sometime else. So... You can imagine what happened next. The man upstairs started banging around. First of all, thank God they live above us and not beside us. Secondly, we'd been talking for three hours prior. This was the last moment I wanted to meet her son. She walked in the door, she gave me a kiss, sat down next to me. Her eyes locked onto mine. She goes, oh, you must be Mark. Thank God I took that extra second to make sure everybody knew who the hell I was. Because otherwise, I would have thought that she had accidentally come into the house. My name is Dan Soder. Thank you. Have a good night.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI was thinking about my last date.  It's not going well.  And I thought that would be like a good starting point to talk about it because we can all relate to bad dates, right?  Like if you've been on one recently, there's nothing better than sharing your misery with somebody else.  That is why reality TV is so popular.  Because they're just shows where people share their horrible lives with other people.  We love watching them go through shit, don't we? And then at the end we think yeah she deserved that actually no i still fancy him he looks nice  that's how it works but anyway uh i was talking to this guy called samantha which isn't his real name by the way  i'm gonna call him something different when i tell you what happened but um samantha um turns out he wasn't Samantha.  He had given me a false identity.  Turned out his real name was Ian.  Which doesn't quite fit the vibe does it now i mean look at the photo here see how handsome he looks yes do you know who wouldn't look like that oh some very tall men that's who  but i didn't find out until later  we met up as planned went back to mine had a few drinks got drunk really quick  and from being absolutely hammered i became completely sober again  because at some stage during the night this man took off his clothes, jumped into an open window, climbed down the side of my house onto the roof next door  I remember looking over seeing him doing this thing I'd only ever seen done before on Game of Thrones, you know what I mean?  Where Jon Snow climbs across dragons.  So I turned around to say hello.  Just sort of looked over there, saw the top half of his naked body climbing away from me.  Looked down to make sure I could ignore everything below that level, except his dick was pointing straight at me  he did not care it was a moment  so i decided the best course of action would be to pretend that i hadn't seen anything  um i tried everything to avoid eye contact  i kept glancing over there trying not to laugh  it reminded me of that scene in Borat where he gets caught shagging that sheep  you know the bit where he tries to hide behind her neck, but keeps getting found out?  Yeah, same situation here.  Then suddenly, out of nowhere, he shouted...  What time will you put the light on please?\n\n## Transcript: got\nI went on my first date recently, I'm proud to say it's going well so far with this one guy but I do have some experience of dating disasters thank you very much indeed.\nIt is quite an interesting thing about me being that age where I've had enough years now to sort of go out with people but still young enough that like when you meet someone new they think you're available immediately yeah right away uh-huh oh please don't be too excited guys i am taken i swear i will never ever marry again okay thanks very much keep laughing um because we're married couples tonight good man no seriously just give me two minutes before you laugh if he was really funny wouldn't there be more women around him by now come on stop it anyway no but I did go out with a woman once she turned up late we were supposed to meet at half past nine her car broke down then she phoned me from the pub across the road said can you pick us up from the other side which sounds nice except this is not how I see foreplay coming okay let's go back to what happened earlier shall we alright so she phones me and says can you get over here we'll wait in the bar while you park up outside take a look all right and I thought okay fine I'd better hurry up otherwise we might miss each other completely because you know what ladies time flies when you're having fun isn't it yes exactly so I rush over put the parking brake on cross the street walk into the door mind the step bust through the doors got straight up to reception turn round looked along the bar saw absolutely nothing resembling even vaguely like a female shape anywhere near the area called over to the staff mate does anyone know anything about these three people sat over in the corner talking amongst themselves looking suspiciously like they could potentially be female but honestly we haven't seen them I didn't expect such efficiency from Wetherspoons so off I trotted over to join those three men who claimed to be the only females present that evening and... (audience laughs)\nNow whenever I tell that story I always finish it by saying we ended things soon after I mean obviously I couldn't trust her anymore right? And also I think maybe deep down inside I felt guilty for cheating on myself or whatever way you want to interpret it but I promise you the night still carried on regardless and we fucked both in fact I remember thinking afterwards wow she has amazing thighs what would happen if I asked her to run tomorrow morning I wonder why I shouldn't find out and guess what five days later we ran together six months later we moved in together eight months later we got engaged eleven months later we got married and four years ago today we welcomed our beautiful little girl Rosie into the world and I promised her mummy dad and baby Rosie we love you forever and every day.\nSo I sit next to them thinking maybe this is awkwardness that I need to break the ice to make things slightly easier perhaps. And I go hey girls hope you guys aren't missing me terribly? One of them turns to me goes, yeah, you mean Emily? Which I found a bit strange. But I guess everyone has their own way of doing things. What I find weird though is that she pronounced Emily Em-ily. And she spelled it E-M-I-L-Y. Just seems counterproductive doesn't it? If you want someone to believe you are a girl shouldn't you spell it Emmie or Amii? That's what I would have done myself actually.\nAnd after several drinks later in the night, I finally plucked up the courage to ask her whether or not she fancied popping home with me for a bit of a shag and she replied, yeah, but next door already has a dog. Thanks for listening everyone.\nYou know sometimes you fall in love with somebody when you least expecting it? Okay? And that person turns out to be your best friend. And that friendship lasts forever. Because you learn together growing older. Laughing together. Crying together. F***ing together. But mostly f***ing. Mainly that.\nI remember thinking why hasn't she told me? And she goes, oh darling, I couldn't tell you until I knew myself. Oh, darling, I couldn't tell you until I knew. She kept saying darling. It sounded like she was trying to persuade herself that our relationship wasn't doomed yet. So I asked her outright, I said, listen, I need honesty here. Is there another man involved? Now, if you're gonna lie to me, make sure it's believable, because I hate liars. Darling, honey, sweetie, no! No way.\nSo after about ten minutes of trying to make small talk with them, eventually a voice came out behind me saying, excuse me, sir, would you mind awfully stepping aside? We need to use the toilets! Oh, sorry. Right. Sorry. You want me to move, you must obviously be a lady. No, I mean, clearly you are. Clearly you are. Because you're telling me to f*** off, aren't you? That's why.\nShe wanted sex so bad that night that she actually pulled me upstairs onto a table where everyone else was enjoying their food and started doing oral sex on me until eventually we both came together now I love oral sex don't get me wrong I do love giving it more than receiving it personally but I didn't realise that I'd been given the full works okay, so I didn't bring any mouthwash or toothpaste.\nAnd I remember thinking as I joined their little huddle, hey, maybe things aren't working between me and Laura after all. Maybe we should swap numbers.\nAnd I remember thinking to myself what would any normal person in this situation do? They'd obviously run away screaming. So instead I thought let's make conversation. Let's try to break the ice shall we? How about we play a little game of guess who? That seemed like a safe bet so I started playing Guess Who with three complete strangers who I believed to be dudes. Just wanted to point out fellas I'm doing okay physically after that night apart from this black eye I got trying to escape from that place and I lost a toe. It has been lovely seeing everyone. Thank you. Have a great rest of your week.\nI was born on the day of the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, that's why I skate so fast. That's why I ice dance. That's why I curl. It turns out everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. And mine happen to coincide with yours. Thank you very much! Enjoy the rest of your night! Goodbye!"
