We spend an hour on our mats, trying to breathe deeply, find inner peace... only to be kicked out of the studio because we're five minutes late for 'Detox Flow'. I mean, it's not like we're showing up to therapy after skipping lunch – Sorry doc, traffic. (pauses)  But seriously, have you ever tried to get into that one popular yoga spot downtown? It's like trying to score tickets to a Beyoncé concert. They tell you, if there's still space available at all, sign up online by Wednesday or forfeit your chance to downward-dog with the Instagram influencers.  I went once; signed up, showed up early, got my mat ready... they told me the class was full due to some'sudden popularity' and offered me a 'waiting list.' Like, do people actually put their names down for something just so they can say no thanks when asked if they want to join the waiting list?  And don't even get started on how competitive it is to leave before savasana starts. The person who leaves first gets bragging rights, probably. Or maybe it's just a desperate attempt to beat rush-hour traffic home. Either way, good luck finding parking near those studios. That'll give you some real inner peace! (laughs)\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI was really excited to go to this hot yoga class, because I love doing stuff where people tell me what temperature to make my body feel like it's on fire for no reason. That is so fun! It makes you want to do more shit! So... So I walk into class early, because that's part of the deal when they're going to put all these other sweaty people around me who also did not need this. And she starts handing out blocks and straps. And if you don't know, those things are made from natural rubber or foam, but they will still get scalding hot inside of your vagina. They'll melt there and then dry up and become a raisin. So now we have six fucking straws just sitting here at our feet? How about one per person? One straw per person. We can use them right away. She hands me two blocks instead of a strap and looks confused by her own decision. Yeah, fuck yeah! This should be good! Two blocks! Let's get weird with this blocky business! All right, let's see how many different ways I could hold a rock while being naked outside. Let's figure some shit out here real quick! Then before I even start sweating, we gotta wait another ten minutes for three people. Now I'm gonna call them latecomers, but technically none of us were on time for anything today except maybe brunch last week, but... Also, she said we couldn't eat before coming here, which isn't true, and that would actually help keep me cool. But she didn't say we couldn't drink. If you think about it, drinking water is hydration and eating food is nourishment, but both can cause stomach discomfort, making an already awkward pose worse. It doesn't take a genius to realize why alcoholics never stop drinking. Because sometimes after a few drinks, you might notice something unexpected. Like the way your face changes shape. Or maybe even how much bigger everything else appears compared to your face. Oh man, I wish I had a drink! Is anyone thirsty in here? Anyone wanna talk? Anybody having trouble getting into their legs? Anyone else wondering how old the dude who invented yoga must have been when he came up with this thing? When he first started thinking through poses, he'd probably sit cross-legged on his bed and go, hmm, what if I bend forward? What if I stretch back behind myself? What if I stick each leg straight up towards heaven? Nope. That's too far. Nope. Too high. Just kinda bend my knees and reach down towards the ground. Yep. Okay. Now breathe deeply and focus inwardly upon your soul. Uh-uh, nope. Not yet. Just kinda lean to one side and look at the wall. Okay. Maybe later. Breathe deep and focus inward. One day he got bored and went, oh boy, what if I stuck each arm straight out beside myself? Hmm. Too long. Hmm, okay, cut it in half. Bend them elbows. No, no, no, pointier than that. Pointiest of points ever. Gotta fold them arms in against my body, otherwise I look like a bird trying to fly backwards. Maybe next year. Anyway, I've decided that every time someone asks me to come to a yoga class again, I'm gonna pretend I heard them ask me to play basketball instead. Do you want to play ball? Yeah, sure, doggy-dog, game on! Bring it on, bitch! Bring it on! You better bring it! You better bring it! Or whatever sports bros say when they want to fight. Anyways, I am super bad at playing basketball. I only mention that because everyone seems to assume that because I'm very short, I'm somehow naturally athletic. Which isn't true. In fact, most little kids aren't athletically gifted until they hit puberty, at which point they suddenly turn into tiny muscle bound versions of themselves. At least that's kind of what happened to boys. As girls matured, however, their bodies typically shifted sideways. For example, when I was growing up, you'd often find me at recess hiding under a bench waiting for nobody to pick me. My dream was always to grow up big and strong enough to lift heavy objects off children smaller than myself without hurting anybody. Unfortunately, that never worked out, but... But I guess I did end up pretty small. Small enough that I haven't gone through puberty once. Still happening daily. This has been Bob Odenkirk. Thank you guys. Have a great night. Bye-bye.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI went to an all-women's college.  The only guys that were allowed there is if they worked as staff members at the school.  So I had some hot young dudes working here.  They're like, oh yeah, we got some guy friends coming up this weekend.  We can bring them back to our dorm rooms?  No! You may not bring any men into your bedroom!  It was a very strict policy.  My favorite one though, my absolute favorite one was like, no, but you could have sex with us outside of campus hours  And i'm like what do you mean by outside of campus hours because i don't know how long it takes to get around campus  But then also who's keeping track?  Like, did someone tell? Was it me telling?  I think maybe that's why I didn't date anyone while I was there.  Because I was always worried about getting caught having sex.  That's probably why I never dated anybody there.  Now when I go out to eat now people ask where should I sit in the restaurant?  Where would be good for two people to sit?  In a booth alone together.  Don't even need that many seats either.  Just enough so I'm comfortable leaning against something.  Thank you.\n\n## Transcript: got\nSet up I was just trying to get some exercise because you know when you're on vacation you want to do stuff but then sometimes like things happen right so i signed up for this thing it's called an over booked yoga class that sounds great doesn't it yeah no one likes undersubscribed activities especially if they have the word book in them right absolutely, don't even need any context.\nSo what happens is there should be only five people doing it, but everybody wants to do it. So we all pay $25 each to go into a room with three other strangers.\nIt turns out overbooked is code for there's only two people coming so we all take our mats off fold them into triangles put them under each other form a pile and then the instructor starts teaching us downward-facing dog.\nSo basically what happens is everyone shows up, not enough mats. Then someone calls a gym, gets sent another person who has no idea where he is.\nI walked into my first day of Overbooked Yoga Class. They were very excited about me coming back every single day.\n And now let me tell you how exciting my life got by going to Over Booked Yoga. All right? Now my daily routine started to look something like this.\n At six o'clock in the morning, wake up early, jump into bed, start snoring loudly.\n Then the alarm clock goes off, jolt myself awake, realize I've been sleeping through my own alarm, panic, rush around the house until I find the battery that went missing from the last time, throw it onto the clock, turn it on again.\n Run downstairs naked, grab my mat, run outside, lock the door behind me, unlock it immediately, open the fridge to steal milk from my roommate's apartment.\n Drink the cold milk down, feel it chill me all the way to the bottom of my stomach.\n Now, once inside the van, I would pretend that I'm driving while simultaneously checking my phone for text messages."
