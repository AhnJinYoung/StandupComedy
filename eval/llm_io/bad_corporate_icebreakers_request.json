Corporate team-building exercises that promise to break down barriers, but really just make you want to scream at your coworkers.  I was at this conference last week where they did the classic 'Two Truths and a Lie' game. You know, where everyone shares two true statements about themselves and one false statement, hoping someone will call out the lie?  But let me tell you, it backfired when our CEO said his two truths were 'I love dogs,' and 'I have three kids.' And then he dropped the bombshell 'My third kid is secretly a ninja.'  We all looked at each other like, 'Uh, isn't this guy married?' (pause)  And don't even get me started on the trust fall. I mean, who thought that was a good idea after college? 'Hey, let's recreate the thrill of freshman year!' No thanks, I'm good.  (cue laughter)\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nIf you're an introvert, just think of it this way, I'm not being aggressive, right? You've got to be nice because there's always someone at work who wants to tell you about their dog. I don't know why that happens but they will let you know what happened with them on Friday night before the meeting starts like we have some stuff going on for sure my name is Jeff by the way okay no one cares so if i were you i'd stop trying i mean look around huh but anyway uh so um yeah so i used to live in new york city and i went back last year oh man i didn't realize how much i missed it until i was there again and then immediately after that i moved to los angeles which is fun too because now when people ask me where do you live i get to say either or and everyone loves that answer i love living out west though i really enjoy it i also hate it because every time i fly east i go through security and they pat down my crotch twice because I am now considered suspicious and I did nothing wrong and they should apologize personally but instead they just slap the shit out of me both times so... Okay, next question! What brings us together today? Oh, wow. This guy knows he has to make small talk before he asks his question. He could be asking anything. Why would I care? Maybe he does want to know about his dog! What do you need to hear about him? Is he missing teeth? Has he been eating grass lately? No more than three seconds. This is why it goes well over four minutes. Because they try to break the ice, which means conversation initiation. So, I'll give you two examples of bad questions from these corporate icebreaker meetings. The first one, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, why are you single? And then number two, what makes you tick? That is a stupid question. It sounds good, but what kind of person thinks those words sound cool coming off of their lips? Who among us thought this up? Weirdo number one must have said something crazy because weirdo number two wrote this down in her notes. Like she never met a dude named David. But here's the thing. If you ever ask anyone in real life, you will find out exactly why they are single. It doesn't take long. They usually start talking pretty quickly into the conversation. They might even bring it up themselves sometimes. One woman told me on our second date. She had her legs crossed and everything, and she looks at me and says... Here comes the truth bomb, guys. She says, all right, here's the deal. I'm single because I recently broke up with somebody else. Okay, we're already halfway to answersville. We can keep pushing forward. She continues. And part of the reason why I split with my ex-boyfriend was that he wanted children. I don't wanna have kids. Boom. Truth bomb landed. I felt my nuts tighten in fear. I was like, hold on, ma'am, slow down. That's awfully quick information dump. Don't leave me hanging without any followup questions, madam. Wait till later tonight, sir. All right? Thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate it. Also, if anybody tells you about their dogs during sex, red flag alert, throw your underwear away. Red flag alert. Red flag alert. Why aren't men allowed to wear dresses anymore? Can we change that rule? Can we allow dudes to rock some flowy fabrics while they play catch with the kiddos? Let's put the boys in tutus, let's see what they do, huh? Dude, you gotta check yourself before you wreck yourself, bro. All right, you heard it. The dress code applies to everybody equally across the board, regardless of gender identity or expression. Alright, thank you. Thanks for laughing along. My name is John Crist. Have a great rest of your day. Bye-bye.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI work at an insurance company.  Does anybody here work in insurance? No? Good! It's awful!  It is so boring.  There was this one day I had to do something called a team building exercise because apparently my job sucks enough already that we need another thing.  So what happened was they took us all off site to some hotel conference room and there were like six people from our office there plus two other offices who worked with me  And basically it just said write down three things about yourself on index cards you know like your name where you live how old you are whatever and then pass them around to everybody else at the table read somebody else's card take note of their answers go back to yours add new questions based on information gathered then repeat process until time runs out  That sounds simple but trust me it takes way too long because every single person has nothing going on in their life whatsoever except maybe one guy named Brian who got divorced recently which by the way not even cool dude.  Like if anything that means now he gets two-thirds of his stuff back right?  But instead of doing it like that what they did was they put everyone into groups of four, and you would sit across from someone you don't know yet, and then they handed you these paper plates.  They're like, okay, write something true about yourselves on your plate.  Then when the music starts playing, pick up the plate next to you and read everything written on it and see if you can come up with something truthful to say about yourself as well without repeating any of those words exactly.  Then put your own plate over top and keep reading the next ones underneath and get better and better responses until the song ends.  Okay, so what happens is like once the first person reads the second person's statement and writes down something good and passes it along and puts their own statement under, now the whole group thinks they can be cleverer than the previous person.  By the end, everybody becomes an absolute dickweed, saying shit no one should ever hear about anyone else.  This girl was like, oh yeah, I went skydiving last year and I'm afraid of heights.  Oh boy, she really wants attention.  The worst part though was later that same week, we actually became coworkers.  Now I feel obligated to hang out with her outside of work sometimes.  She asked me to watch her dog while she goes away.  If nobody knows anything dumber, tell me now.\n\n## Transcript: got\nI'm sure you've all been to one of these meetings, right? You're sitting around with some colleagues from work and there's also someone new that nobody knows who they are or what their job is.\nAnd then suddenly out of nowhere somebody will go something like, hey guys can anyone guess how many hours it would take to watch netflix if we watched non-stop? Or, does anybody know where our CEO lives?\nOr my personal favorite, did anybody else hear about what happened on Monday night when Donald Trump got arrested again? So weird! And I was like, nope, don't have any idea whatsoever.\nBut this guy goes, well, actually, he didn't get arrested because he wouldn't let them arrest him. He just kept talking until they had to leave. Because apparently he has this thing called presidential immunity, which makes me wonder why everybody keeps saying he doesn't read books.\nSo now I think I'll make fun of this particular meeting more than anything else. There's always usually a bit of tension in these sorts of gatherings as well. Like people sort of feel awkward not knowing each other very much. But then sometimes things come up that really break the ice, you know?\nLike, so one time at an office party after drinks were flowing a little too freely, somebody started going off on how racist white people are towards black folks, and then another person stood up and said, oh yeah, but Asian dudes love working for money!\nI swear to God, he went on to say that! It's true though, isn't it? We do love cash.\nSo uh it becomes clear pretty quickly that neither of us care about politics okay i mean clearly not this dude cause he thinks voting works like um not this guy either obviously because uh i am asian american and i voted for bernie sanders.\n(incredulous laugh) Oh man, I thought that'd be a real divisive point among you guys. Yeah, Bernie Sanders won California by far and away the biggest margin of any state.\nAnd if anyone doesn't like socialism... well then fuck you.\n Now, here's the funny part. This dude comes over and starts lecturing me on American history. No seriously, he gets face to face into my grill and starts explaining that if I wanted to vote for Bernie, I should learn more about his policies.\nSo now every time I see him coming towards me with an iPad in hand like he wants to show me some shit on YouTube or whatever I'm just going to be like hey can you turn it off please? And then get back in there! Get in there!\n He says, I understand your frustration, but you gotta remember, it wasn't easy getting rid of slavery in America. People used to own slaves. Okay, fine. First of all, secondly, I hate to interrupt your lecture, but it still happens today. Thank you very much!\nIt's like when they're like, why don't we have more black people on Game of Thrones? And then white people get defensive because they're just like, there were no black people around during medieval times! It was all white dudes with swords.\n One of the best ways to deal with ignorant comments like those is to just shut down their ability to talk altogether. In fact, last year, there was even an article published online titled, The Best Comebacks When Someone Says Asians Are Good At Math!"
