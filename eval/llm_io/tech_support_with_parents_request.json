Tech support people... for my parents' generation! (pauses) I mean, they're like superheroes of troubleshooting.  So, Mom calls me saying she can't figure out her computer. And I'm on the phone trying to guide her through it – Click'start', no wait, click 'exit'. Oh, don't press anything yet! It's like we're playing this crazy game of 'tech-support telephone'.  Meanwhile, Dad is watching over us thinking he knows more than both of us combined. He starts yelling into the phone, What do you want from me?! You think I just sit around all day clicking buttons? Um, yeah, that sounds about right.  I swear, if there was an Olympic sport for holding one's breath while listening to someone explain how to use Windows Explorer, my family would take home gold medals every time. They make it sound so complicated!  But honestly though, after years of dealing with them, I've realized something profound If technology were easier to understand, we'd be living in a world where elderly folks say things like, Oh, great, another Zoom meeting. Not Why does this contraption have a button labeled 'Wi-Fi' but still won't connect?  That's progress, folks. That's innovation. Now let's get back to figuring out how to use Google Maps... again.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI've got one of those phones, that new Samsung phone. It's quite good because it does all these things I don't need on my phone but... you know what I mean? It can make me look clever if anyone else has this phone like they're impressed by it right um so i'll use it to show them how clever i am yeah sometimes people get jealous when other people have better stuff than we do isn't that funny? Like oh he had an iPad before tablets were invented or something. But anyway, there was a problem with this thing. And my dad is not very technical at all. He doesn't understand computers, but he wanted to try and fix his son's computer problems, which made sense until about halfway through our conversation, where I realized he didn't actually want to help me solve any problems; he just really enjoyed talking into machines for some reason. So basically every time there was a beep or anything like that, he'd be like, 'Oh! What's happening? Oh! Is it stuck?' And then suddenly realize, no, Dad, it's fine. Nope, everything seems to work normally now. Everything's back up and running again. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Which was annoying, because it wasn't helping. What happened initially was that his SIM card stopped working in the Samsung Galaxy S III, which sounds fancy. Yeah, well, turns out it's not. So I called Orange customer services, who said I needed to reset my network settings. Now, my mum loves saying words she thinks sound posh even though they don't necessarily go together. She likes using her little phrases from television programmes. She used to watch Midsomer Murders. So whenever someone says murder, she goes, darling. Darling, darling, darling. Darling, darling, darling. Anyway, so she hears me say resetting, she went, ooh, yes, darling. You must reset. Yes, indeed, Mum. Yes. Reset. Then eventually after many hours later I managed to sort the issue out myself and phoned him to let him know and he goes oops sorry darlings next time just ring orange so we live too close to each other maybe and i think we should probably move away from each other mum dad you know when they're always ringing and bugging you they kind of become overbearing so you think you might kill them it's interesting being related to somebody you could potentially kill but also love and care for That joke works best if everyone agrees that their family members could definitely be murdered under certain circumstances. I'm going to leave you guys with two pieces of advice from my father today. Firstly, never use a microwave oven to heat up frozen peas. Secondly, never put cheese toasties in your freezer. Thank you very much. Enjoy the rest of your night.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI called my dad's computer guy once.  Yeah! He was like, so what seems to be the problem? And I'm like, yeah, it just won't turn on.  And he goes, oh no, that is terrible!  So we need you to go plug it into another outlet real quick because if your father's house has any faulty wiring then we're going to know about this by the end of today  so i plug it into an outlet and it turns right back off again  and i said well that's weird do you think there might be something wrong with the computer itself?  He went, why would anything as magnificent as technology fail when all that happens around us is perfect?  It turned out not to be the faultiest wiring at his place.  Also, who says that?  My mom calls me every day to ask how her Facebook account works.\n\n## Transcript: got\nI'm from Florida, which is great because if you're ever there on vacation and someone's like, hey, we should go to Disney World! And then they say where it's located, Orlando, Florida, you can just be like, nope.\nSetup My dad still uses AOL email. That's right, America Online.\nSetup When my mom first got her smartphone, she called me crying one day because she was trying to call me but couldn't remember how to dial using this new device that had replaced all of those old numbers.\nShe kept calling me with the number for pizza hut because i think it sounds more like my name than our phone number.\n It's not so bad though. The best part about growing up in Florida is seeing people who have never been before. They always act exactly like you'd expect them to when going somewhere for the very first time.\n Whenever I travel home, these tourists come up to me after shows sometimes, and they'll be like, oh my God, I love your accent. Where did you grow up? What city or state?\nI know what's coming next based off their expression already.\nAnd then they're going to say where I grew up. And it is not New York City! But no one believes me because of how good my American impression is.\nThen finally last year, someone believed me. This girl came up to me, she was so excited. She goes, oh my god, I can tell by your accent that you actually from Australia.\nWhat's happening is people see one black person on TV and they think we all sound like LeBron James.\nYeah, that happened recently too. A guy hit me up on Instagram DMs out of nowhere saying he loves my comedy but why do you get booked everywhere except Atlanta?\nSetup And I said, well, maybe it has something to do with everything around here being pretty much underwater due to climate change.\n Now it seems like every time I try to leave town now, I end up getting stuck here forever.\n I wanted to take an Uber over here to Brooklyn tonight, but they told me Hurricane Ian made flooding possible as far north as Connecticut.\n So I've been waiting outside for hours looking for another ride.\n I didn't even need the hurricane. Just weathered through a heat wave. Because living proof that global warming isn't real."
