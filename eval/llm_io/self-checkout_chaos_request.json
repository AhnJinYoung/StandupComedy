We've managed to automate almost every aspect of our lives, but somehow we still can't figure out how to use those fancy self-checkouts at the grocery store without losing our minds.  I mean, who thought it was a good idea to put a computer screen between you and your food? 'Cause that's just asking for trouble – or at least an existential crisis when I'm trying to scan my avocado toast. (pause) And don't even get me started on the codes! 'Why is this item not being recognized?' Oh no, did I accidentally type in 'avocado' instead of 'avocad0'? That's like choosing between two flavors of regret!  And then there's the inevitable moment where the machine decides to take its sweet time scanning each individual banana... while I'm simultaneously arguing with myself about whether buying seven bananas constitutes hoarding or simply having high hopes for a decent smoothie game come Monday morning.   But honestly, have you noticed how everyone around you seems to be secretly competing in some sort of bizarre checkout Olympics? Like, they're all silently screaming, Mine! Mine! whenever someone else tries to grab an empty lane nearby. It's basically just us all collectively saying, 'Hey, let's pretend we enjoy waiting in line!'\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nThere's been an uptick, recently, of self-service tills popping up everywhere that I've noticed. They're on every single supermarket shelf now because they save time for the staff members who work there. So if you don't need help, then just go through one of these little machines. And it seems like quite a simple concept, doesn't it? Just scan all your items off, pay with card or cash, put them into bags yourself, get out the other side, but no! Because what happens is when we step behind those barriers, something within us clicks and we become completely useless. We look at each machine differently than anyone else does. It looks normal to everyone else, right? But me, personally, I'm terrified of scanning my own shopping. I have this fear where I think someone will jump out from nowhere and attack me while I'm stuck between two screens trying to find whether Tesco Finest strawberries come under fruits or dairy products. That never ends well. In fact, not long ago, I did experience such an incident. A guy leapt over my shoulder and started going for his waistband before realising he'd accidentally jumped past about seven people already so instead ran away down the aisle. Oh! No wonder people prefer talking to robots though isn't it because even when someones angry or annoyed with their customer service rep all they ever do is repeat back exactly what i said i rang johnson controls yesterday was very rude lady on end of phone kept repeating back everything i had told her can you imagine if she hadn't done that would be absolutely horrific wouldn't it sir yes ma'am could you tell me how much a baguette costs um oh god please let me talk to your supervisor straight away thank you thank you, madam. It'll only take five minutes. Please hold. If anything were to happen, they can track our movements across all shops via CCTV cameras. Do you remember last year? There was that huge scandal involving Morrisons supermarkets after several customers claimed they'd seen security guards physically dragging shoppers screaming back to the front of stores just so they could manhandle them onto these ungodly contraptions and throw them between rotating blades and watch as they disintegrate into nothingness now i know that didn't actually happen but i like to believe it did anyway because i enjoy hearing older generations complain about new technology but I live near Heathrow Airport, which has got automated gates around it. Not sure why they bother with those anymore, really. Now, they're not smart gates either. Just old-fashioned ones. You press a button, turn round, face forward, walk towards gate. That opens, allow you through. No problem whatsoever. Except whenever I use mine, the woman standing next to it always gives me such dirty looks. She thinks I'm f***ing with her. The way I use it, I see her first, make eye contact, wave hello, wait till she acknowledges me back, then hit the button. Then both of us sort of glance over, check each other still haven't moved, nod again, smile, carry on waiting until eventually I push off and move slowly forward just so I appear less intimidating she starts tapping foot impatiently looking at me thinking am I gonna pass anytime soon yet so far nobody's complained but you should hear the complaints I receive at home my girlfriend hates my family more than anything hate them all especially my dad apparently apparently he's awful yeah according to her anyway she's constantly telling me stuff about him like things he's done in the past say once i was telling her about my childhood growing up told her how hard times were how poor we lived in council flats no money coming in we couldn't afford food all we used to eat was baked beans three meals a day that's all we ate he went to school hungry every day because parents chose to spend the little bit of spare change we had left over buying booze rather than food for children it gets worse too at night i used to sleep with a bin liner wrapped around my head cos i thought mice were living inside there eating all the blood in my brain anyway she heard this story and she goes ah yes uh-huh yeah sounds familiar you must feel terrible having grown up like that i looked at her i thought hang on mate this wasn't the worst thing he's ever done you might want to listen to the rest of the story before judging his character if you're ready to continue then alright what happened years later years later he sent my sister and brother to Thailand for free where they met their Thai mother for the very first time something none of us knew existed they loved it so much they ended up staying in Thailand for good and now live happily ever after there in a place called Phuket isn't that nice? Apparently, Dad being a horrible person is okay if he sends kids halfway across the world and makes dreams come true for them. Yeah. But if Mum chooses baked beans over fish fingers one day and vice versa another, she becomes the devil incarnate. Okay? Is that... Yeah. Thank you guys very much. Have a great evening. Goodbye.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI went to Walmart recently.  Not my favorite place.  Because I hate going through those automatic doors at Walmart that open up when you walk towards them because they know your fat ass is coming by themselves  and then just as quickly slam shut behind me like, oh no! She's lost!  And she was right.  It took me forever to get back there.  So it turned into one of these days where... Like, I didn't even care about shopping anymore.  I'm just trying to find the self-checkout lanes so I can be alone with myself again.  Like, you need some time away from people?  Just go check out yourself. Right here.  But before we do this, let me tell y'all something real quick.  If you don't shoplift now, what's wrong with you? You're wasting your time.  No seriously though, if you don't steal stuff from stores, you might want to think about getting better stuff.  That's all I'm saying.  Anyway, I finally found one of those machines.  Thank God. It's quiet, peaceful, nice break from everybody else.  Now I could relax.  This guy comes over next to me.  He starts scanning his groceries.  Looked down at him, he had on socks and sandals.  All right, buddy, you're not doing too good today either, huh?  We both stink.  Yeah, I've been wearing those Crocs since April.  Thanks for asking.  Oh yeah, it got warm once, but...  ...it ain't hot enough yet for flip-flops.  Okay? Get off my nuts.  Stop laughing, yes ma'am, you sound ignorant.  Your turn, sir.  Let's hear it.  There's only two kinds of footwear acceptable during summertime, okay?  Sandals, which means toes exposed, not socks and shoes.  Or boots, cowboy boots or hiking boots, anything with laces long enough to keep sand out.  Anything less than three inches above the ankle bone is sandals, baby girl.  Don't try to come up under me with that.  Hey, excuse me, sir.  What'd I say? You want to talk about ignorance?\n\n## Transcript: got\nI'm just going to say this right now, okay? If you're white and I don't know that you're white, but based on how long it's taken me to figure out what kind of pants you have on, by the time we finish shopping together, if there is a shooting in America, I am blaming y'all. That's my policy. You understand? Okay? My friend Rachel told me she was at her local grocery store with her little boy who has autism, they were doing their weekly shop, when another woman came up to them and started screaming at her child. She said, hey lady, stop hitting your kid! And then my friend Rachel explained that he wasn't actually hitting himself. He had just learned to make noises like he was getting hit so people would help him open his own bags at checkout using our hands instead of those stupid bag machines because some of us are better than other things. And the woman went off on her about being an ableist bitch.\nI mean, look, here's the thing. Like, I get it. There's a lot of problems in society right now, all right? We can agree on that. But I think one issue where both sides might be overdoing it, for example, I feel like the word ableism gets thrown around way too much these days. All of a sudden everybody's an abelist, every single person, even if they only say something once. Even if they haven't been educated or exposed enough yet.\nLike, I'll tell you exactly what happened. This girl comes running into work like frantic. The manager rushes her back behind the scenes. It turns out somebody called the cops because she was yelling at her kids while driving down the highway.\nLike, yeah, you heard me. Somebody yelled at her kids while driving, not vice versa.\n Now the police show up and they asked her why did you yell at your kids while driving down the highway and she goes oh officer I didn't I was in the car with my daughter she was driving.\n Now the police show up and they ask her why'd you yell at your kids while driving down the highway, and she goes, oh, officer, I didn't. I was in the car with my son. He was driving.\nOh! Yeah! You guys don't want to hear about it? Okay. It's cool.\nShe's like, well then how did he get out of jail?\nYeah! This is how you know we're better parents than y'all. Because when our kid's bad behavior gets to us, instead of yelling, what do we do? We just stare out into space like, hmm... where did all these road rage drivers come from?\nYeah! And it turns out he's not even old enough to drive yet.\nAnd he's like, okay ma'am, well, did anybody else hear yelling coming from inside of there? And she goes nope! Because it happened before we got married."
