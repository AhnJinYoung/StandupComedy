Gym mirrors. Those things are like social media for fitness enthusiasts, but with more sweat and less likes.  I mean, have you ever been to the gym during peak hours? It's like everyone's competing in some sort of bizarre Olympics – except instead of running or jumping hurdles, they're all flexing their muscles and making duck faces at themselves.  And then there's the classic move checking out one's own behind while pretending not to notice anyone else around them. I'm pretty sure that's just code for 'I've got nothing better to do than admire my butt.'  But let me tell you about the real MVPs – those guys who take selfies mid-workout, grunting away on the treadmill or bench press. They're like, Oh, look! My biceps are so big... *flex*...my phone is going to be jealous! Give us a break!  It's also hilarious when someone spots an imperfection in their reflection (a stray hair, perhaps?) and suddenly becomes engrossed in correcting it, completely forgetting why they even came to the gym in the first place. Newsflash nobody cares if you get rid of that single errant strand; we're over here trying to keep our legs from buckling under the weight rack.  Gym mirrors might seem harmless enough, but honestly? They're breeding grounds for insecurity and narcissism – two qualities no one needs in excess, especially after a good workout. Maybe next time I'll bring a sign that says, Please check yourself before wrecking others' reflections. That'd definitely make for some interesting gym small talk!\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI'll tell you who's my least favourite person to see when I'm at the gym, okay? It is those f***ing guys that do their bicep curls with their palms facing forward so they can show off how big their biceps look on camera from behind. Okay? Yeah! You know what I mean? Like this! What an absolute c**t move right yeah like it's not even about building strength or muscle size for them right now it's purely just vanity and ego right because they want everyone else around the gym to be aware of just how big their fucking arms are and then you got to wonder why these boys aren't dating either i don't think anyone would ever go out with somebody doing bicep curls with their palms facing towards themselves you're going to scare everybody away man just scary uh-uh look at me i've been working hard every day i haven't missed one single leg day since last year so many red flags there but i suppose if we could turn back time maybe he'd be perfect for someone very specific he'd have all her family photos framed up by his fridge door um oh my god he doesn't eat meat does she love him so much no thank you sir i am way too intelligent for you okay you're absolutely insane but if you were looking for some kind of soulmate level relationship, like a wife or something like that... ...do yourself a favour, get married to a guy that does his dumbbell rows with both hands gripping the same end of the barbell. He will treat you incredibly well, yes? He won't care about appearances, he won't be bothered about fitness and diet, he won't give a s**t about whether your body fat percentage is two per cent or twenty percent. The only thing that matters is being able to carry everything together. That's how marriage should work. One person carrying all the other stuff. Do you agree with me on that one? No? Well let's try another question shall we? Have you ever seen anybody doing deadlifts where they bend down really low and lift the weight all the way up above their head without once touching anything else apart from the ends of the weights? Yeah? Alright. Have you ever wondered afterwards? How did that dickhead manage to put that thing anywhere near any part of their body? How did they get it in? It defies logic and physics. Just pure magic happening before our eyes. What sorcery is this? They must be keeping their dicks in pockets deep within their upper thighs. Just pull it out whenever duty calls. But honestly speaking, I hate seeing deadlifters more than anything else while I'm at the gym. Because whoever invented deadlifting was clearly trying to prove that women shouldn't vote. Like, I genuinely believe that if men had done their fair share of lifting heavy shit throughout history, feminism wouldn't have happened today. There's no doubt whatsoever. If we saw more men bending down extremely low picking things up over their heads everywhere we went, female suffrage would never have taken place. We can agree on that. Can we? Yes, good, we're having a lovely little chat here tonight. My name is Tom Lucy. Thank you very much. Good night.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI'm gonna be honest with you guys, I hate going to the gym.  The only thing that keeps me coming back is seeing other dudes do it.  Like if there's one dude at the gym who makes all his sets look like they're done by accident, then I know he works out every day.  He doesn't need any motivation because he loves doing this shit so much.  And what gets my heart rate up more than anything else?  When some guy starts looking himself up in the mirror while he's working out.  That's when things get interesting.  No matter how simple their exercise looks, just watch them check themselves out after every single rep.  What the fuck? You don't even want your bicep curl to end yet!  But here we go! Oh no, did I lift correctly?  Oh man, oh man. The whole time i thought i was lifting but now i feel like i've been lowering  i should have known cause i didn't hear anybody say lower right before i started  that'd probably be somebody named steve though wouldn't it always steve  steve would come over everybody start getting into formation  and then once everyone's set let him count down together  three two one zero okay now you got to keep those arms straight until you hear me go again  you can see yourself doing it too  but nobody likes you, Steve.\n\n## Transcript: got\nI was walking down the street, I saw this guy with his shirt off on the way to get some ice cream from that truck that just plays one song over and over again like they're trying to trick you into buying something by being consistent it's genius i'm gonna go ahead and give him another dollar but anyway um so he had his shirt off and uh... He said hey bro what kind of protein powder do you use? And I thought about saying something funny or cool but instead I just said whey because I don't know anything else besides whey. But then we both walked away. We were two guys who didn't have time to waste our lives talking to each other right now. That is how you grow up, okay? You gotta keep moving forward.\nI got back home later that day and my brother called me up, he goes, yo man, did you see the video I posted today? I was like, nope. What'd happen? He says, all right, calm down, everybody. This is crazy stuff here. It happened last night. A woman fell onto these train tracks and she died. Everybody stay safe out there. And he hit send before adding that her body burned, which made the whole thing seem less urgent.\nAnd for those of y'all not familiar, whenever somebody dies on television, whether it be a show or a movie, as soon as their character gets killed, if you watch an episode of The Walking Dead where Negan hits somebody with Lucille, everybody in America stops doing whatever they're doing to watch the rest of that show.\nSo I'm watching TV, and it happens every single season when someone new gets murdered on Game of Thrones, everybody's texting me going, oh my god! Did you hear about this poor girl who died getting run over by a car on live television?\nSo I'm watching TV, and it happens every single season when someone new gets murdered on Game of Thrones, everybody's texting me going, oh my god! Did you hear about this poor girl who died getting run over by a car on live television?\nNow suddenly everyone has access to the internet. Everyone can see everything happening everywhere around us.\n That means every morning at 7 o'clock, I wake up and I immediately check Twitter to find out what racist tweet Donald Trump tweeted while I slept.\n And then I also scroll through Instagram real quick to make sure Kylie Jenner still doesn't own any cars.\n I think that we've become too connected.\n Like, I remember years ago, people used to tell celebrities that they looked like other people.\n Then they would say things like, yeah, Tom Cruise looks like a little baby lion.\n But nowadays, celebrities look like regular old people. Like, Jennifer Aniston could totally be your aunt."
