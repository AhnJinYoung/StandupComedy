The conversations we have with complete strangers while taking off our shoes.  'Where you headed?' 'Oh, New York.'  That's not an answer; that's a city. I've got no idea if you're going to Times Square or Central Park. You might be on a mission to rob a bank or attend a Broadway show – who knows?  I had one guy say he was heading home for his grandma's birthday party. And then five minutes later, another person asks him where they were from originally... Turns out this same dude is actually British but has been living in Australia since college. Grandma must love international travel!  And don't even get me started on when someone says their destination without any context at all – just deadpan 'Miami.' Like it's a declaration of independence rather than a flight number.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI was at JFK Airport recently, they were doing that thing where you walk through the metal detector or you can put your stuff on the table for them to pat down, right? And I'm just looking around thinking about how weird it is that we all know what's going to happen next. Like no one's surprised anymore when you go through an airport security line because there will always be some point during that process where someone says something ridiculous out loud and then everyone else has to agree with him before he feels comfortable continuing on his way. Right? Like, every single time without fail. So I get up there, my phone comes off of my belt buckle, which isn't even allowed now by TSA regulations so... But whatever... And she looks me dead in the eyes like this and goes, Mr. Smith, do you have any sharp objects in your luggage? And I look back her straight faced like this and went, no ma'am i don't think anything could survive that journey. That's how bad a job I am at being confident. It would've been easier if I had done cocaine. Then I'd be over here like, nah bro, nothing. Just a little piece of chalk. She didn't believe me either.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI was just at JFK with my friend.  We're going through airport security. We're like two black dudes together doing what we do best. And this lady, she's like, oh my God, you guys look so cute together!  And I'm thinking to myself, bitch please! It ain't that cuteness. You know how much ass whoopings it would take before me and this dude cuddle up like little piggies?  Like five? Six? Seven if he got some big titties out there, you feel me?  But no, it's not that shit. That's why they call us thugs because we don't get along with people  She said something crazy though man cuz i didn't say anything but when white people make a comment about race now i've been around enough white people to understand their culture  i can pick up on these things quick as hell so then after she made her comment uh she goes excuse me um sir miss did either one of y'all leave your laptop open well yeah our laptops were closed the whole time right thank you so much be safe out here okay byeee!  The whole thing was weird to me too. Like, why is this woman speaking to us while other white people are looking at us?  Why'd you go above everybody else? Did you need something from Home Depot?\n\n## Transcript: got\nI'm from L.A., which is great, but it's kind of hard to do that with TSA agents because they're always like, where you from? Like, what does this have to do with anything?\nI'm just trying to get through the line so I can be on my way. It's not relevant information. You know how many times I've gotten caught doing drugs?\nFollow-up question What was that supposed to mean?\nAnd then there were some people who said nothing, which made me feel worse than if they had asked. One guy even tried to make eye contact, which felt like an attack.\nThen I got off the plane back home, and one thing about going out of L.A. for too long is when you come back, everything seems normal again. People start talking to you normally.\nI ran into friends right away. They were asking questions as well, but more innocuous ones. Where'd you go? How was your trip? Which is fine.\nAnd we started catching up and stuff. But it wasn't until later that night that things really returned to their usual place.\nLater that night, she was saying something weird about our relationship. She goes, oh yeah, no matter where I am or what I'm doing, whenever you call me, immediately my heart skips a beat.\nAnd all I could think was, wow, that doesn't seem healthy. At all.\nBecause before I left, she would talk about how much she missed me. So now hearing her say that, I thought maybe I should miss her.\n-  So instead of being excited, I panicked.\nLike, okay, cool, good. She called me three weeks ago. No big deal. That's why I'm having trouble sleeping at night. And I don't want to act like this is a huge issue between us, but every time I hear from her, especially after such a long period of radio silence...\n(incredulous tone) Because before I left, she would talk about how much she missed me. So now hearing her say that, I thought maybe I should miss her. I didn't realize that missing someone was an option.\n It turns out you can choose to miss somebody. Like, imagine all those commercials you see on TV telling you that losing weight won't happen overnight, but it will take work. Missed person is real. All right."
