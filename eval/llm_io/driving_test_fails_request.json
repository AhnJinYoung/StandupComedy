They're like the ultimate stress-test – not just for you, but also for your examiner. I mean, have you ever seen an adult person sweating bullets while trying to parallel park? It's like they're competing on 'The Great British Baking Show,' except instead of cakes, it's three-point turns.  And then there's the joy of getting feedback from your examiner. You know, the kind that makes you question every life choice you've made since puberty? Like when they say, 'This is incorrect because... (pauses)...you forgot to check your mirrors.' Oh no! The horror!  I failed my driver's test five times before passing. Five! That means I had five different examiners who got to experience me yelling at myself in a car with hazard lights flashing. One even asked if I was okay after I screamed at the mirror-checking sign. My response? A sweaty smile and a mumbled, 'Yeah, yeah, totally fine.'  But honestly, failing those exams taught me something valuable how to make small talk with strangers while pretending I'm interested in road safety. Now that skill will come in handy someday.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nMy name is Tanya Moore, I'm from North London originally but now live on the south coast of England with my husband John and our two children Freya and Jasper who's very excited to be here tonight because he got his first pair of pyjamas for Christmas which was lovely thank you so much that was really nice it wasn't actually me that bought them no don't look at me like that i didn't buy him any clothes um i have just been buying her stuff right she's getting bigger every day she looks more and more like me oh god if they're still paying attention frey has already started doing that thing where she picks up toys off the floor and then puts them back down again uh what the hell am i meant to do with this kind of behaviour? I've never had kids before. Never needed to know about anything like that before. And also, and we were going to get her vaccinated against all those diseases that come around once every couple of months or something isn't it love not yet though too young too young too little too small too vulnerable let's keep putting it off one week becomes three weeks becomes six months and by the time she's five years old everyone else has had their jabs 15 times over yeah we'll wait until there's another pandemic then that should give us enough time right um anyway life goes on obviously john works away quite a bit while i stay home looking after these gorgeous people that's how it works best job ever being mummy honestly couldn't recommend it highly enough even when you break an ankle playing netball which is exactly why they invented shin pads but anyway you can imagine john will often miss out on lots of things whilst he's working away especially big milestones like school trips holidays birthdays whatever doesn't matter what it is john won't see it probably wouldn't even notice either way so i thought well maybe i could surprise him yes with a present yeah bring him home a gift nothing says happy birthday daddy does it than some new kitchen appliances absolutely spot on perfect timing darlin' we're going to need the extra space for your massive head that comes along with being the most wonderful man alive yeah john loves presents obviously i think everybody likes presents i mean nobody dislikes presents except for freya right frey hates presents hate hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hated it i took her into hampers recently picked her up a little basket full of goodies chocolate biscuits crackers etc and straight away just went no! No! Get it away! Get it away! I said, Freya, darling, sweetie, honey, pomegranate, poppy seed cake, almond croissants... She looked at me and went... What? No idea what happened in there, okay? Just disappeared into herself completely. Lost all communication skills. But anyway, John loved the kitchen appliances, enjoyed using them, everything worked fine, good quality products, fantastic customer service, great price point, really made my husband feel special. Oh, hang on a minute, sorry, guys. I might have missed my moment earlier. I'm supposed to tell you my big news. My big news is I passed my driving test. Thank you, cheers, wow! Yeah, thanks, I did pass! And, um, it felt amazing, I must say, passing the driving test, finally done it, you know, after four attempts. Can't believe it, mate. Can't believe I did it. But, you know, fourth time lucky, eh? That's what they always say, innit? So, last year I failed my third exam. It was awful, devastating, heartbreaking, really broke me, but I bounced back stronger than ever. Three days later, I signed myself up for another go, reared up ready for round number four, baby. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, I remember failing my second test vividly. Not least because it occurred during lockdown. Yeah, do you remember that shit show? How ridiculous it was, how absurd? They were saying things like, stay safe indoors. We're gonna put the grandkids through Zoom classes. We're gonna work remotely from home. Stay indoors, we're gonna shop online. And I was thinking, if only there was one place inside my house where I'd rather be. Where would that be? Behind the wheel of a car. What a relief, what a release it was having both hands free again. Because previously, I'd been forced to hold the steering wheel with one hand while texting my dad with the other. That was the only option available to me. Honestly, we survived on WhatsApp alone. He used to send me messages, say things like, Hey, Tanya, hope you're managing all right. Did you manage alright? Hope you managed alright. Oh God, please make sure you turn left in approximately 400 feet. You can't afford to mess this up. And I'd respond to each message individually, trying desperately to type fast enough without swerving onto the hard shoulder. It's a miracle I passed at all. The fact that I passed was pure luck. The examiner told me afterwards I was very close to failing. He gave me loads of feedback. First piece of advice was stop drifting across the road divider like a bloody pirate. Next tip was slow down, slow down, slow down. Apparently, I drove past him waving at him smiling laughing enjoying myself while breaking speed limit. Just wanted to say hello to somebody, and there he was behind me, sat there grinning from ear to ear going, hey, hey, hey, mate, slow down, slow down, slow down, you're going to kill yourself! Anyway, I'm glad I passed, because otherwise I wouldn't have been able to drive out to Brighton to celebrate properly. Had such a wonderful night. Had dinner, saw a show, drank cocktails till midnight. Spent money I shouldn't have spent, met friends I hadn't seen in ages. Felt fabulous, truly fabulous. Even managed to get parking, which is no easy feat. I parked perfectly legally, paid for it and everything. When I returned to my vehicle hours later, I found £50 worth of damage inflicted upon it by someone attempting to park illegally nearby. As soon as I spotted it, my heart sank. As quickly as possible, I rang my insurance company. I explained the situation, and they assured me that they would cover all costs associated with repairing the damage incurred to my property. Took note of registration numbers of surrounding vehicles. Very responsible driver I am. I hung up the phone feeling relieved, confident that justice had been served. Until suddenly, I heard footsteps approaching my vehicle. Turned around to find a woman pointing accusing finger towards me shouting, excuse me lady, I noticed you rang your insurance company. Why did you ring your insurance company? Why did you call your insurance company? This woman clearly had mental health issues. She had to have problems. Only reason she approached me was because I called my insurance company. Because she was worried I was making false claims. Wanted to report me to the police for fraud, for dishonesty, for deceit. Couldn't believe anyone would do such a terrible thing. If only I knew then what I know now. Next time, next time, next time, I swear to God, if I pull over anywhere near that cow, I'm running her over. Right, that's my time. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful evening. Bye-bye.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI'm having my driver's license taken away.  It is so annoying because I've been practicing to pass it since last year  but apparently you can't just practice your driving test every day like that  you're not good at golf right i don't think anyone who watches this show is really into their sports but if you were great at golf wouldn't be allowed to keep playing until you got better would they yes no okay well why does anybody get to drive cars then honestly when did we ever agree on this oh yeah one time there was too many people crossing red lights and somebody said let someone else try how about him he seems nice give me a chance hey man come back next week maybe we'll talk again  So what happened?  My instructor rang up two weeks ago and she goes, hi John, I need to tell you something. You failed your test today.  And I went, ah! And she says, I know, I thought so as soon as I saw you pull out from the stop sign!  Which isn't true by the way. She didn't even see me do anything wrong.  She's making all this shit up off her head. It's very stressful trying to fail an exam while simultaneously being attacked personally by another person.  But anyway.  That wasn't the reason I failed.  The real reason I failed... the examiner pulled me over after three minutes and told me to turn left ahead.  Now here's where things start getting quite complex with regard to road safety and physics.  If you go straight on, you will crash into a lamp post.  If you turn left now, you may kill yourself.  What am I supposed to do? There's only one thing you're supposed to do in that situation according to the Highway Code. Yes, signal which direction you intend to go.  Then put on your indicator light and hope to God nobody sees either of those signals before you make your move.  This guy didn't fall for it though.  He looked down both roads and picked the least likely place for me to end up dead.  Or worst case scenario, killed loads of innocent bystanders along the way.\n\n## Transcript: got\nI think one of my favourite things to do when I'm out on dates is watch people fail their driving tests, you know what I mean? Like if someone's taking me somewhere, they're like oh it doesn't matter let's go have an ice cream or something and then we get there and some guy just failed his driver's license so now he can never leave this place again which seems pretty cool to me that's great i would date him right okay but no he'll be like yeah man i should tell her about how i passed the first time round she'd love hearing all about that and i'd be like mate don't bother because honestly nothing else really matters after seeing somebody drive into traffic does it? Like... It was amazing! Did anyone see that? That little red car went straight over there! Oh my god! So close though wasn't it? Yeah! Passed with flying colours actually!\nI've seen men who still live with their parents pass their test for the very same reason that they will marry them, okay? They haven't tried anything better yet. And they won't either until one day when they're walking around in socks looking for the remote control and they hear themselves say aloud, I wish Mum had taught us how to use the oven properly.\nOh no! What's wrong son?! You should have listened more carefully back there! It wasn't a microwave we were talking about you numpty!\nThe problem is now you can get all the things on Amazon Prime! You don't need to know how to cook any more! It's so good isn't it?! So many people have no idea what cooking even means anymore. What's cooking mean if not shopping? That's it. If someone says do some work I'm like oh my god yes please give me an amazon credit card alright mate i'll go and do some fucking work thank you so much yeah just let me sit down over there somewhere i'd appreciate it thanks alright i'll be doing some cooking soon enough cheers bye\nYou think you hate your dad's house now just wait till he tries to f***ing kill himself by putting his head inside the microwave door it'll be like oh my god what is wrong with him what happened i didn't know microwaves worked that way we never used ours i'm not gonna go near it don't touch anything stop touching everything put down the phone leave me alone why do you want so much cheese on your pizza get away from there no give me back my tinfoil hat give it back let go of the hot tray let it go mum come downstairs tell the police call an ambulance someone ring the fire brigade he doesn't mean to hurt anyone he can't breathe get him outside open all these windows turn off the stove shut up shh hush daddy no please daddy calm down please daddy stop daddy stay right there i got you daddy yes daddy it's going to be alright daddy daddy hold onto me i love you daddy i have to cut your shoelaces because if you hang yourself I'll never forgive myself.\nI think if you could have sex with anyone from history dead or alive it would be Cleopatra because she was so powerful no wonder Mark Antony fellated her into oblivion right yeah he didn't even know what he wanted but then there's me mum i'm not gonna lie guys my number one historical person is actually my mum just because she never said no to me growing up like ever really made sure we were fed and watered all the time too much of an overachiever maybe don't do drugs kids come on give me another go. Thank you. No, thank you. Yeah.\nOh! That's where you put it, isn't it? Don't look now, but my dad just gave me his number. Yes! Thank you so much, guys. Enjoy the rest of your night. Take care. Bye-bye.\nThat's right ladies, if you want to keep him forever get rid of his dad because it is only ever going to be two against one. Okay? You don't even need to leave the house. Just wait till he comes home from work on Friday night. His old man'll have been waiting by the window all day. He'll come bounding down the stairs like a little golden retriever. Oh boy oh boy did you see my grandad today he came out of me just like you said he would i told him not to but he wouldn't listen now look what we got there lad give over let her go mum she knows best yeah no way i'm keeping him anyway mummy says so and then you take him upstairs shut yourself away in the bedroom close door lock door turn key scream out into hallway hey everyone welcome to our home do not under any circumstances open this door thank you. Thank you.\nIt's great news! All you need now is an older man or woman ready to die of loneliness with you. A match made in heaven! The whole thing works out perfectly! You can get married on her deathbed. She'll do all the paperwork. Your mum gets a bit of peace knowing she raised someone else happy before she croaks it herself.\nYou know what? If you have got a son or daughter living at home past the age of 25, then get out there right now and get yourself an ironing board! Because it is time to stage an intervention because your child has been brainwashed by mum into thinking that absolutely everything can be done on high heat setting number nine.\nNow you know why there's always someone standing outside Tesco on Fridays trying to sell me these two boxes of eggs. You see right now it is a bit inconvenient because my house has just been burgled so what we need is like five pounds worth of value meal ingredients from Asda or somewhere like that do you think that would help yeah i'll take those uh no no no no no thank you um all right i'm going home alright bye"
