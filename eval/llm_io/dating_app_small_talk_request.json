We're all just sitting there, swiping through profiles like we're shopping for shoes – 'Oh, I'll take this one with the good hair.' But then you start talking to someone, and it's like trying to have a conversation with Siri on mute.  I was chatting with some guy, and he said, What do you like doing on a Saturday? And I'm thinking, 'Dude, that's not even a real question anymore!' It used to be, but now people say stuff like, Do you travel often? No, dude, unless by traveling, you mean walking from my couch to the fridge.  And don't get me started on questions starting with If. Like, if you really want to know something, why not ask directly instead of giving me an existential crisis? If you could go anywhere... Oh no, please tell me I can go somewhere where I won't die alone!  But honestly, sometimes these conversations feel more like hostage negotiations than dates. The other day, someone asked me, Are you looking for anything serious? And I thought, 'Wow, finally someone who wants to marry me... after five minutes of messaging each other.'  It's funny; when did our lives become so transactional? Can anyone else see themselves in a Craigslist ad at this point?  Anyway, if any single men or women out there are watching, let me give you some advice next time you swipe right, put down your phone before asking the life-altering questions. Trust me, it makes things way less awkward. Or should I say, less deadly? (laughs)\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI like going on dates, I think it's good for you to go out with people. If someone goes out with somebody every now and again they're gonna have something that makes them feel alive. It might be sex or an Indian meal but whatever that is just make sure you've got one because i'm not getting any younger here uh yeah no um thank you very much yeah i'll tell you what though right i was trying online dating recently which i don't recommend by the way if anyone wants some advice do all of those things that people say about how you should never judge anybody based upon their profile pictures and stuff like that well forget about them because honestly there were times when I thought I'd accidentally swiped into tinder accidental match swipe back next time let me get my thumb together okay thanks guys but anyway so this girl she had two photos on her profile picture number one it was her from behind wearing a towel basically naked apart from the fact that everyone wears towels around their waist nowadays you know what I mean? So she has the classic pose where she's standing in front of a mirror, looking at herself in the mirror, showing off these toned biceps. Now, you can imagine why I would want to meet up with this woman, right? But then... Picture Number Two... She put a photo of herself face-to-face in glasses. Oh! She looked like my nan! Honestly, it's true. It really did look like my nan who does wear glasses mind you. Okay, fine, maybe that was unfair, because my nan doesn't really look like anybody's idea of attractive, but still, we could both pass off as being called Nan on Tinder, couldn't we? And I said to myself, hang on, surely there must be more than two women on the planet who look like different ages, sizes, shapes, heights and weights in two photographs side-by-side. There's only one person left that fits that bill hasn't been invented yet. My mum came down after seeing me last year. When she saw me doing the gig, she went, oh, John, congratulations, mate. You've lost weight since the last show. Thank you for noticing. Yeah, yeah. So I made a decision, right? When I see my mam more often, I need to lose less weight. Because my mam comes over once every few years. And when my mam sees me doing the gig, she says exactly the same thing each and every single time, doesn't she? Which means that technically speaking, if we assume consistency, theoretically speaking, I haven't actually lost anything, have I? Because I weigh the same amount every time my mother sees me. That's amazing, isn't it? That is absolutely incredible. In fact, if we work our maths out correctly, according to theoretical physics, logically speaking, I am currently losing weight faster than Usain Bolt runs. Yeah, that's amazing. That's fantastic. No, seriously, though, I will try and diet properly soon, alright? I promise you that. I am working towards that goal. The problem is is that whenever you stop drinking alcohol for quite a long period of time you realize how little social interaction you require to survive. Like I didn't even miss it until I started missing it. But before lockdown obviously I used to drink socially occasionally sometimes too much but now I stopped and I realized what happened to me was I found myself becoming one of those people who thinks that other men who drink don't understand anything at all about life whatsoever. A lot of my friends told me they're stopping smoking during the lockdown. They said they're giving up cigarettes completely. I think that's great, don't worry about that. But what they also did while they were quitting tobacco, they decided to quit booze as well. And there's always one guy among us that decides he's gonna give everything up cold turkey. Well, this particular fella gave everything up without telling his wife first. He sent his wife an email titled, 'Giving Up Booze'. All it said inside the body of the text message was, ''Just wanted to let you know that I'm giving up booze.'' His wife replied immediately and wrote back, ''Give it up!'' This bloke's name is Dave, by the way. He lives near Birmingham. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this final bit of material from Dave himself. Here we go. Here we go. Hi, hello, hi, hi, yes, please. Hello, my name's Darren, but everybody calls me Dazza. Right, so I live near Brum, Birmingham area, you know. Not far away from Castle Bromwich, lovely place, nice people, beautiful houses, wonderful schools, excellent football team, Aston Villa Football Club. We play Birmingham City FC, but nobody cares about them, do they? Good, carry on laughing. Carry on. We laugh in Alabama. Do you remember what happened earlier in the pandemic when we kept hearing the phrase stay alert keep yourselves safe stick to the rules protect others stay safe stay home save lives that meant nothing to me till I tried staying sober hello my names darren but everybody calls me dazza and this is my story okay i lived in a house with three lads and we loved having parties and nights out together as young fellas but deep down we knew that one day we weren't going to be able to continue living like that anymore so we all made a pact amongst ourselves we said right listen we'll wait till one of us gets married then whoever marries first leaves the house he moves out he gives us £1,000 cash handover and we leave him alone forever we won't bother him ever again that sounded fair enough that seemed reasonable now fast forward couple of months later one of my best mates Steve got engaged and we're sitting round celebrating and we're thinking happy days we're going to split up and move into better accommodation we're going to divide all the household bills between four instead of five we're going to upgrade all the TVs in the living room we're going to double glaze the windows we're going to install air conditioning units everywhere and put a Jacuzzi in the middle of the kitchen floor and then suddenly reality hit me hard as hell I realised I was never going to marry because I'm gay. It took me six weeks to pluck up the courage to come out to the boys in the house. I finally managed to muster up the confidence to sit them down and break the news to them and I said, guys, I've got something important to tell you. Guys, guys, guys, I've got something important to tell you. I sat them down, broke the news to them, and I said, guys, I've got something important to tell you. I've got something important to tell you. Guys, I'm sorry to say this, but I'm afraid I'm gay. One of them turned to me and he said, what are you talking about? How dare you call yourself gay? I'm straight, and I bet I'm straighter than most of the people in this country. What I mean by that is I hate all forms of music except ABBA. I love watching Coronation Street. I fancy Marmite. I voted Leave in the referendum. I like listening to classical music. And I prefer eating plain digestive biscuits over chocolate digestives. As you can probably tell, I wasn't ready to come out and admit that I fancied Marmite. Thanks very much for coming tonight. Have a great night. Goodbye.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nA lot of guys like to ask this question.  They'll go, hey man, what do you think about when it comes to your ideal partner? You want someone who's smart?  Yeah! Yeah, I feel that way too.  I don't know if anyone else feels this way either but i'm not looking for anybody really dumb because then i'd be stupid  i would just end up with some guy who doesn't even understand sarcasm so he thinks everything i say is real  like we're arguing over whether or not pineapples belong on pizza and he thinks I mean it  that's not cool right now  if you meet somebody online, they always tell you never send money to strangers  but every girl on Tinder looks exactly alike, which means there is no stranger risk  What am I supposed to do? Not swipe left until she sends me her Venmo information first?\n\n## Transcript: got\nIt's really hard to get through all of these apps, because you have to go through so much small talk before it gets good. Setup Because when I was young and dumb, I thought that if there were like an easy way to meet somebody new, then maybe they would be perfect. Setup And now my friends tell me what happened last week on Tinder? A guy asked how many people did he kill? Setup Like who is this fucking madman? That's insane! He just comes out with it! Setup There used to be a time where it wasn't weird or inappropriate to ask someone about their job, but also not everybody works. Setup People do things. They work odd jobs sometimes.\nYeah! Every citizen in America should receive a stipend from birth until death. Setup And everyone has the right to keep learning whatever the fuck they want without consequence.\n You don't know anything about them yet. So you're talking about your favorite thing ever. What's your favorite hobby? Oh man... Hiking! No shit! Me too. Do you love hiking more than sex? Yes. Absolutely.\n The only reason why I say that is because we can both hike as much as we want. We could see each other every day for the rest of our lives. If one person didn't show up to the meeting, would you care? Not at all. Would you call? No. Would you text? Nope. You'd probably wait till sunset, send him a search party, find his body, drag it back to town, bury him six feet under. How dare him not commit to a casual outdoor activity.\nI'm like, hey man, what's going on? He goes, oh my God! What happened last night?! Where have you been?! I go, where were you?! He says, I was out hiking with this dude named Steve.\nAnd then he'll be like, hey man, if you don't bring my stuff back with me, I'm going to make sure everyone knows about how gay you are. And I was like, yeah, dude, just leave. Go ahead. Get out of here. That's fine. Whatever.\nBut then you'd have sex with me on top of my dead boyfriend's grave while I'm crying about how he left us because he had an eating disorder.\nOh my god! And then go on Facebook Live like, he's gone missing again. This time, I'm scared. Please help me find John Doe. Like, bring the dogs out there. Send SWAT team through those woods over there. Get a helicopter in the air. It'll be fine. He's an adult. Don't worry about him.\nAnd then go on Tinder again like nothing ever happened. Just be hot. Like what the fuck do you need commitment for? Do whatever the hell you want!\nYeah! And then he wouldn't even have sex with me when I get there! He's like, oh no, now my commitment issues aren't just about people. Now they're also about nature.\nI'm like, how do you know he's dead if there ain't no body? What kind of crazy ass shit am I supposed to believe?"
