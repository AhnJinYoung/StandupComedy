When you order a coffee, but before they even make it, they've already decided to be best friends with you. (pause) I'M SO EXCITED TO MAKE YOUR LATTE TODAY! It's like I'm getting ready for prom or something – 'Who am I gonna wear?' 'Should I get a latte art heart or leaves?'   And then when you ask them how their day is going, they launch into this epic story about... their cat's dental appointment. (sarcastically excited tone) Oh yeah, that's exactly why I came here today to hear about Whiskers' root canal.  But honestly, have you ever noticed how much caffeine these people must consume just to keep up this level of enthusiasm all shift long? They're basically functioning on pure espresso fumes at this point. That's not a job, that's a lifestyle choice.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI'll tell you one thing I've noticed recently, which is that some of these coffee shops have got completely made it for themselves with their staff, haven't they? And what's happened? They're really enthusiastic about working there now aren't they? Do you know those places where every member of staff has been put on performance enhancing drugs? They just can't wait to get out from behind the counter any more can they? If you go into them today like this right they come up at you yeah i'm sorry did you see me coming because i had my eyes closed i was so excited to be here oh man yes please could i also have a chocolate muffin no not chocolate brownie we don't do muffins mate all right all right well if i may say so then we don't do brownies either but... But... Oh, God! Okay! So it's going to cost £2.25, okay? Oh, I am broke! So I need two sugars, thank you very much. What kind of milk would you recommend? Almond, coconut or oat? Okay, fine. Skimmed will do. Can I pay by contactless card? No, seriously though guys, I think some of our young people might be taking things too far. Like I saw an advert last year for Costa Coffee and they were advertising a job as a part-time barista and apparently one of the qualifications required was to speak English fluently. Now I thought that was quite unnecessary myself cos obviously most customers want to order something simple. Something along the lines of give us a bagel thanks or make me a flat white right but let's face facts shall we you'd still expect to hear someone speaking english when you walk through the door wouldn't you? Instead they open mouthed like what did she just say oh god he didn't mean anything by that love she means nothing by it absolutely nothing she meant a lot by it honestly because uh actually i should explain before i start talking about costa coffee i should explain um i used to work for them full time. Well I worked for them until they sacked me after three months because I kept falling asleep at the till. It wasn't even during busy periods either. Just whenever anyone came to collect their free drink voucher, I seemed to nod off. Anyway, the reason why I bring this story to your attention tonight is because shortly before being fired, I remember having words with one of my colleagues. She said to me, she went, Tanya, how long does it take you to fall asleep? And I replied, well, Amy, it depends upon whether or not you're telling the truth, doesn't it? Because if you're lying, I won't sleep again for another six years. That joke fell flatter than a scone without cream, unfortunately. Unfortunately, I found out afterwards that the phrase'six years' is commonly known within the industry as the amount of time it takes to become a manager at Costa Coffee. So I guess technically I'm doing alright. Thank you very much indeed. Good night everyone. See you next time. Bye-bye.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI'm going to tell you guys something about me.  This is not easy for me to admit as an adult.  But I still like coffee with a little bit of foam on it. You know what I mean?  Like when they just squirt out all that milk at once and then pour it into your cup so there's some extra milk right here in the corner where no one else can see it but you get to enjoy it  And if you're lucky enough to order their fancy drink like a latte macchiato whatever that means...  ...then you gotta pay $10 more dollars than everyone else who ordered regular old black coffee because that's how much they charge you per layer of froth that you want.  It's insane!  Now, I live near Starbucks because my dad works here every day at this Starbucks.  So we go there together sometimes. And he loves them too. He thinks they make him feel good about himself.  We'll walk up. We got our list written down by number. We don't mess around.  My dad always starts off strong. Right? Like really confident. Walks up to counter, gives his name, says the first item on his list.  They write it down. They ask us another question.  Second thing comes next, same confidence.  Then we start getting repetitive questions from these baristas. Different ones.  They don't remember anything from last time either.  The second-to-last person asked me why I wanted whipped cream on my hot chocolate.  Why do you think she didn't give it to me? She was like, oh, yeah! That's disgusting! No way!  I'm like, well, excuse me, ma'am. But according to the menu board behind you, those two things are actually made for each other.  She didn't care. She wouldn't listen.  One guy took forever making my mom her usual cappuccino.  He finally finished after three minutes.  Hands back to my mother said, hey miss here is your normal cappuccino would you prefer whole wheat crust or white bread for your croissant?  That's a different breakfast food altogether. She didn't even laugh though which tells me maybe she'd never been inside before.  Maybe she thought it was a real restaurant.\n\n## Transcript: got\nI am sick to death of these over-caffeinated b****** that work behind coffee shop counters, right?\nThey're like, what can I get you? What do you want today? They just go straight off on one, don't they?\nWhat's wrong with them?\nI think there should be some sort of age limit when people start working behind coffee shops or bars because if your personality is still developing inside your body, shouldn't that mean we hold back all those opportunities for you until later?\nCan you imagine being 15 years old in McDonald's?\n I would come up every day after school, order a Big Mac meal, then instead of asking me which size sauce, ask me what my favourite flavour was.\n And I'd say, sweet and sour. And he'd take two squirts from each bottle and mix it together.\n So now I'm nine years old walking home through an alleyway and this guy comes out of nowhere goes, excuse me mate, how much does your mum weigh?\n Now, as any normal nine-year-old kid would have done, I looked down at his feet went oh s*** oh no where did i put him give us um but no not me\n i panicked so i ran across the road to see her well she came running towards me she said nick tell me what he asked why did he ask that question\nI'll never forget it. Because she turns around runs back over to my house and then comes out with my dad holding a big brown envelope.\nI said, because you're my best friend's mum.\nThen just to make things worse, I had to explain what an orgy was.\nI said because of all these f****** trees around here you've got to be careful it's like being an auntie right if you're an auntie when one of your nieces or nephews asks you a question you don't know how do you answer it\nI was like ah because you were having sex with my dad."
