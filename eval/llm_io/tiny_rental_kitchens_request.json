The kitchen is basically just an afterthought, like 'oh yeah, we'll throw some cabinets over there.' (pauses) I mean, have you seen those tiny rentals lately? It's like they're trying to see how many people can fit inside with their arms crossed.  And then you try to cook something – pasta sauce, eggs, maybe toast... but nope! You've got to do it on that postage-stamp-sized counter while balancing on one foot because of course the other side has a giant sink taking up all the space.  I'm pretty sure the landlord thinks if we can't even get this small cooking thing right, we deserve ramen noodles for life. And honestly, at this point, I think I'd be more productive buying instant soup than fighting my way through those microscopic appliances.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI was going to tell you about my relationship, but I'm not really ready for that yet. That's fine! My boyfriend is very nice! Thank you so much! That means nothing coming from you because this guy would be on TV if he weren't already doing it. He's amazing, though. We're having fun together. One of our favorite things to do when we hang out is watch me cook. It sounds crazy, but there's something sexy about watching me make ramen noodles or whatever. And honestly, sexier than anything else I can offer him at home. Because his old place had like a full kitchen with all four walls intact. So now whenever he comes over to my apartment where everything has been ripped out behind me... ...he gets treated to an incredible cooking experience every single time. Every step of making food back here feels exactly like what I imagine being raped by someone who doesn't know how to use power tools must feel like. But they'll laugh later. There's always some weird little bonus thing that happens along the way. Like last week, while I was boiling water, I accidentally knocked off one of my glasses from the shelf, which shattered into hundreds of pieces everywhere around me. But then after I cleaned up most of them, another glass fell down from nowhere, just hit the ground perfectly, and exploded into thousands more pieces right next to me. Which made the mess even worse. But also kind of impressed, you know? When I turned around, I said to myself, oh shit, did I throw one? How many have I thrown? Why didn't any get stuck to me? This isn't happening. This isn't real life. There's no way. Then I looked outside through the window and saw two cats staring at me like I'm a fucking magician or something. They were both just looking at me thinking like wow she could fly too i don't think anyone should eat tonight actually thank you guys so much take care bye\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nA couple years ago I moved into my first apartment.  It's one of those apartments where they call it an efficiency apartment because there is no kitchen.  That's what they called them when people were really efficient at cooking but now it just means you're shit out of luck.  I was like, oh this is cool! It'll be fun to cook together!  And then we got in there and it was so small that whenever he tried to stir something with his hand, he would hit me in the face.  So yeah, let's not do that anymore, shall we?  We don't even need to date again, okay? We've already done enough harm  This place has been around since 1892 which honestly feels about right if you think about it considering how long it took us to get married  My husband loves our little microkitchen though He thinks it's charming And I'm happy for him So am I But I miss having food options beyond toast  There's only two appliances in here A toaster oven and a microwave You know when a building says it has a toaster oven that doesn't mean anything It could just be some weird dude named Toby Owen living down there doing whatever Toby Owens do  He can make all kinds of things in here too Like pizza casserole  Like I said we both work full time so we don't eat together much Which is fine.  But sometimes I feel bad for him Because he eats alone all day every day by himself while working from home as well  The same four walls That guy needs to break free man Break free Get outside Go see other humans Make new friends Play fetch with strangers Just go get yourself a dog god damn  If your girlfriend won't take you anywhere why not bring your own companion everywhere that way everybody wins\n\n## Transcript: got\nThe top door opens up into the fridge itself and then there's another bottom drawer that comes out separately from the fridge just for all the frozen stuff.\nSetup So if you want ice cream or something, you can open the freezer compartment without opening up the rest of the refrigerator.\nBecause sometimes when I'm like eating cereal or something in the morning, my stomach'll get too full really quick because they're so big.\nSo what happens is, as soon as I finish breakfast, right away I feel bloated to start off with.\n Then about an hour later, I think maybe I need to go take a nap.\n I don't know why I do this either because I always have work to be doing during the day.\n It could also happen where I might eat lunch early before I leave work.\n And by the time I come home around dinner time again, I feel tired already.\n And then after dinner, I've got nothing left to do but watch TV until bedtime.\n My housemates, we live together. They moved here recently. So everything was new for them.\n They didn't even notice how much space there was between us.\n They thought our place had been newly renovated.\n All they did was put some fresh paint on the walls and install double-glazed windows.\n(Crowd laughs)\n But no one noticed anything else."
