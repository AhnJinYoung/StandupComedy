Gym influencers on Instagram, that's who! They're always posting these super-cut videos of themselves doing squats or deadlifts... but what they don't show you is when their phones die after three reps (laughs).   I mean, have you seen those 'before-and-after' transformation vids? The before part usually looks like someone took a selfie with one eye closed while running from an existential crisis – Is this all there is? And then, boom! After six months of intense exercising and meal prepping, it turns into, Oh look at my abs! I'm just over here thinking about how much protein powder was involved.  And let's talk about those obligatory workout selfies where everyone smiles for the camera mid-set? It's either because they've got some sweet new fitness gear to promote or they genuinely believe the only thing more important than getting gains is looking good while sweating (laughs).  But honestly, if we could see behind-the-scenes footage of gym influencers actually working out without filters, highlight reels, and #gains goals, maybe I'd be inspired too. Just saying.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nOh my god, guys, I love going to the gym so much! You know what's really fun? Gym influencer videos where they film themselves at every step of their workout? Like, you ever see those Instagram Reels? Where it just starts on them doing bicep curls with a caption that says something like, morning motivation! And then mid-reel, it cuts to them deadlifts, but now the caption is like, oh no, what am I gonna do for lunch today? No! Then there'll be another cut later on in the reel, this time it will be an overhead shot of them running on one of these giant treadmills while eating chicken salad out of a bowl. This time the caption might say something more ominous like, why did I sign up for CrossFit again? Then finally towards the end of the video there's always some kind of reveal or punchline where maybe if we're lucky she pulls back her shirt and shows us all her abs. Or better yet, he drops his pants right down to his ankles and reveals to us that yes indeed he does have a penis after all. It looks small compared to his personality though. That shit must be cold. I don't get how people watch other humans exercise, you know? That seems like such a weird thing to watch someone else do. Weirdly enough, even weirder than watching somebody work out, is when they give themselves commentary during said workout. Where it sounds less like sports commentary and more like just regular old person-to-person conversation about nothing at all. For example, imagine being on the subway and seeing a guy sitting across from you staring into space looking very concerned. He leans over to you and whispers something shocking in your ear like, hey buddy, can you believe Kanye West was almost president once upon a time? Can you wrap your head around that level of gravitas? There's also sometimes it feels like gym influencer reels are trying to convince me to go to the gym too by making it sound like the most relaxing place on earth. Like it's not the same vibe if it's just you versus everybody who watches Fitness YouTube. But yeah, that'd be cool. Maybe next time I'm free I should join him for a deadlift. What do you think? Would that be nice? Or would that be super awkward? Like if I showed up uninvited to his apartment, I guess i could bring wine. Wouldn't want things to feel too tense. How long do you usually keep the camera rolling before turning off the lights and having sex? Is that allowed? Is anybody stopping you? No, seriously, stop recording. Put that away. Stop laughing, put that phone away. Put that recorder away. Turn that microphone off. Come closer. Let me whisper something in your ear. If you need any tips, I've got plenty. Okay? The world needs fewer people. The planet's overcrowded. We gotta thin the herd. Just take yourself outside behind a tree and shoot yourself in the fucking face. Whoever invented guns deserves our deepest gratitude because holy fuck. Thank you so much for listening to me talk. Good night!\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI was walking down the street with my friend.  We were just looking at our phones as usual because we're good people doing well thank you very much  and then he goes oh look there's a girl taking pictures of her body in the mirror window reflection that is what it means if someone says i'm taking selfies all day but they never show their face right?  That means it's not about vanity, you know? It's about checking how your thighs align.  But this one took it to another level, man.  She had like three mirrors up against a wall going into infinity, and she would walk from left to right across them all so that every angle of her body could be seen by whoever was watching her get ready in public  she even set up her phone next to herself so she could film over her shoulder to capture those extra angles that way too I guess it wasn't until she started speaking out loud to herself though that I realized this lady was insane  like when she said things like ooh yeah ass does look great today and stuff like umtill she said something that really broke me bro  it'll always remember what she said cause it kind of sounded like she was talking directly to me and everybody else who saw her  um... She looked straight through us and went, yo! You guys got nothing better to do than watch me put on mascara?\n\n## Transcript: got\nI just hate it when I'm doing something normal like going to the toilet or taking out my contact lenses, right? And then suddenly you hear that unmistakable sound of an iPhone camera shutter clicking away in real life. And you think to yourself... what? What is happening?! Why do we live on this planet?! It's nuts! Right? We're losing our minds over there. No one knows why they're alive anymore.\nOh man, I was walking down the street recently, and some kid snapped a photo with his phone, and he went running after me to hand it back because apparently it caught him looking weird by accident. So now I know how Princess Diana felt all those years ago.\nNow every time I see someone with their finger hovering over the screen as if waiting for something magical to happen, I feel myself being pulled into that vortex too.\nI'm like, oh my God, there's magic out there! Then I get sucked down the rabbit hole of an endless browser tab.\nSo I find myself scrolling through Instagram until I've scrolled so far I end up staring at some stranger's profile picture wondering where did I go wrong?\n Yeah, but people don't realise, you can be anywhere in your house, right? You could be having sex, you could have got ready for work.\n But here comes Binx, mate. He'll creep into your bedroom while you're getting naked. While you're putting on your socks. In the bathroom, while you're washing your face.\n And then he snaps a quick shot of you with your mouth hanging open and your balls swinging free.\n Now listen guys I love technology I genuinely believe that tech has improved our lives massively okay let's not argue about that.\n The problem though is social media hasn't made us happier has it fellas no way right?\n What happened is we've lost control of who gets access to photos of us."
