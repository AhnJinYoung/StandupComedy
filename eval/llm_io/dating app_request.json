They're like online grocery shopping, but instead of just buying milk, you're hoping to buy love or at least someone who won't ghost you after one date.  I was swiping through Tinder recently, and I saw this guy with a profile picture that said 'Climbing enthusiast.' Which is code for, 'I'm either going to die on a mountain or get into an argument over who left the dishes dirty.'  And then there were these guys claiming they can cook up a storm – literally, because their pictures showed them wearing chef hats while standing next to ovens. Like, dude, we don't care if you make a mean spaghetti Bolognese; do you have any actual substance?  But my favorite part is when people put up profiles saying things like, 'Witty banter expert' or 'Adventure-seeker extraordinaire!' Meanwhile, our conversation consists solely of me asking how old they are and whether they still live with mom... and dad.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nMy friends keep telling me that I need to get back out there, which is nice, but also kind of annoying because it's like they're saying my pussy's going stale or something. I'm not on Grindr anymore though because every guy says the same thing about their dick. They'll be like, oh man you can put whatever size condom on me. It doesn't even matter. And then when we fuck, it feels exactly like putting on a winter coat. Just gets tighter with each passing moment until eventually I have no choice but to leave the house naked. Also everyone always asks how big I am these days too, so yeah... Yeah... But honestly, if anything happens now, let people know that I was just taking medicine for gout. Yeah, so uh... Just got out of one relationship, actually, pretty recently. It lasted three years. We were together for two months before he proposed. He's really sweet, so I said yes. That whole year leading up to our wedding day where we would walk around holding hands, smiling at strangers, laughing at kids' jokes, feeling happy all the time. Then finally after nearly an entire lifetime of happiness together we tied the knot and I became Mrs. Mr. The other night while watching TV I realized that without her last name, I don't exist. Like she has this family history. She comes from some very old moneyed white families who fought in wars against Native Americans, and my side of things? All my dads ever did was work at KFC. So thank you so much for coming to this show tonight! You've made my dreams come true! Okay? Yes, okay! Thank you guys so much! Goodbye forever!\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI'm going to tell you something about me before I get into this story.  Before I do it though, let's just set some things straight with y'all real quick.  Yes! Yes! Thank you so much!  Thank you so much. My name is Ali Sadiq. I am gay as fuck.  And if your sexual preference is not one of these three letters, then we don't got shit to talk about right now  But that being said uh i live my life pretty openly as an openly gay man which means people see me all over town like restaurants bars whatever  and sometimes they'll come up to me and be like hey mister why'd god make you gay um because he wanted somebody around to clean his house but also he was bored.  That's how God works. That's how God created us.  He gets bored at night. He makes new stuff. You know what? It doesn't matter.  It's okay. We're here. Let's move forward.  So I've been doing online dating again recently.  Now, I hate online dating, obviously.  We all hate online dating except for women who actually find love through it.  Those bitches are fucking geniuses.  They should teach them in school. They would have better Tinder profiles than math equations.  All right?  When girls succeed, everybody wins.  Guys lose every time.  Because when you go out there to meet dudes, guys always want more from their matches than they give back.  Like men will say stuff on their profile pictures like, six feet tall, athletic build, loves hiking.  Then when they match with someone, it's just, oh my God, hi! Oh my God, thank you so much for liking me.  Oh no, I saw your pic and I thought, damn, look at those pecs. Damn, that ass looks nice too.  But she didn't ask anything.  She asked herself questions.  What does that mean by athletic build?  Does that mean you run marathons?  Or did you play college basketball for two years until you hurt your knee?  Let me keep swiping till I figure it out.  I can't trust nobody.  Men lie.  Women lie. Everybody lies. Nobody tells the truth anymore.\n\n## Transcript: got\nI've been on this thing called Bumble, has anyone else heard of it?\nIt's like Tinder but when you swipe to match with somebody they have the option to just send you back an image rather than words which is nice I think that's quite sweet actually because sometimes if someone sends me something really cheesy or cringey I'm like oh my god get away from me how dare you.\nBut now there's only pictures so even though he might be saying something stupid his picture will make up for it right? Or maybe I'll meet someone who doesn't know what Bumble is and we can both live our lives free from judgment. That'd be cool.\nSo I was swiping through and I got matched with some guy and sent him straight back a picture of myself and then he did the same as well.\nBut here's the problem guys, my phone decided to autocorrect me and turn my name into penis.\nI didn't even know what had happened until like five minutes later when his dick came up on the screen.\nInstead of saying sorry about that what i actually wrote is send us all your nudes we're going to keep them safe you know like a penis museum or something so i've been sending random dudes pictures of my vagina just trying to get it back.\nAnd so instead of just sending it over like normal, my phone went, oh no, we can't do that. We're gonna change you to penis.\nI'm sorry! My dad is very upset because he can't get Tinder anymore.\nHe sends it back now so now there's two penises on Tinder matching.\nI don't think it would have worked if it had just been accidental.\nSo now we're just having sex while looking each other up on Google.\nSo now there is no way to distinguish between his dick and mine.\nSo now every time we text each other it says hello from penis can i come over"
