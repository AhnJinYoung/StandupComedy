We're living in an era where our appliances have more personality than some of my relatives. I mean, who needs human interaction when you've got a fridge that thinks it's funny?  I was trying to get something out of mine last week, but instead of just dispensing ice or whatever, this thing starts talking to me like we're old friends. Hey buddy, why so cold? It's like, dude, I'm trying to chill some beers in here.  And don't even get me started on its'motivational' messages. My fridge is always saying things like, You can do better! or Eat fresh today. Like, okay refrigerator, thanks for the life advice. But honestly, if I wanted to hear from someone with such great taste – pun intended – I'd invite myself over to Gordon Ramsay's place.  But seriously though, who thought this was a good idea? Smart fridges... because what could possibly go wrong with giving household devices personal traits? Maybe next, they'll start judging us based on how many leftovers we leave inside them. (pauses) That would be a real concern!  All jokes aside, folks, maybe these smart home gadgets will become sentient one day... but until then, let's keep laughing at their sass! Because trust me, my friend, no matter how much data they collect about us, there's still nothing quite like having a bad relationship with technology.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI'm happy to be doing this for you, man. It's very exciting. A lot of people don't know that I have Tourette's syndrome because it looks like every other white guy who ever had an opinion about anything. But yeah, if there was any doubt based on my body language or speech patterns, let me just clarify right now by saying I do indeed suffer from Tourette's syndrome, which is great because I love being different, but not everyone does. So when someone asks how many of us out there live with Tourettessyndrome I always want them to give more specific answers so we can all feel included even though they're asking the question but honestly speaking i think it would probably be easier if we were talking to each other face-to-face instead of over some computer screen wouldn't you agree sir? Because then I could see what kind of day you've been having before answering whether I think you should worry about getting shot down again. That's why I wish that Facebook Live existed back at the time when I first got diagnosed with Tourettes. And unfortunately, things didn't turn out well for me, did they? Didn't work out real well. My parents put up posters around town. We went door-to-door trying to find a kid that fit the description. Turns out he wasn't found until much later in life when somebody started making really good videos online called Jeffree Star. Oh! Oh, that joke doesn't quite land yet. Give me another minute, okay? All right. We also tried therapy, which... Which made things worse. The therapist actually told me to relax while I tattled on him! Yeah. Yeah, thank you guys for laughing. Sorry about that. Sorry. All right. No, seriously. Things aren't funny anymore. It's too hard to get stuff done. Like, we need to talk about our phones. This is going to sound crazy, especially since no one has seen me in person lately, but... I am addicted to my phone. Like, I cannot stop using my phone. I use FaceTime to order food, check myself into a mental hospital, send nudes, text my family members during meetings, Facetime to watch TV shows, play Fortnite, read books, make playlists, listen to podcasts, browse Twitter, watch TikTok videos, scroll through Instagram stories, shop online, play Tetris, call my grandma, check the weather, look up recipes, take pictures of the clouds, play Snake Classic, Facetune selfies, write articles, check email, record standup specials, edit movies, film music videos, Facetime friends during sex. Wait, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on. What'd y'all say? What'd y'all say? Did you hear that? Wow. That felt amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. No, seriously. Stop clapping. You shouldn't be cheering. What happened earlier tonight, that wasn't normal behavior. And nobody likes a weirdo, alright? Nobody likes a freak, alright? Nobody likes an outsider. Nobody likes an oddball. Nobody likes an anomaly. Nobody likes an irregularity. Just throw away your phone. Go outside. Play catch. Take a nap. If you saw me today after show and gave me a thumbs up, please keep giving me those. Those mean nothing to me either way, okay? Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go update these jokes on my phone. Anyway, enough about technology. Let's move on to something else. How about appliances? Anybody familiar with Amazon Alexa? Anybody heard of her? She's cool. Very popular among ladies. She helps you lose weight and gives solid dating advice. When she wants to hook up with you, she whispers sweet nothings directly into your earpiece. Whenever you try to hit her, she responds by reminding you that you're fat. Has anybody met a lady named Echo? Is anyone familiar with Google Home Mini? Doesn't matter if you don't understand the reference. Just remember, you're wrong. Also, welcome to hell. Google Assistant is a little bit creepier than Alexa, isn't she? Not sure why you laughed at that one. Not everybody loves Google Assistant. Some people hate Google Assistant. Some people can't stand her. One person wrote, oh, she sounds creepy and passive-aggressive. Another one said, she seems condescending. And then last year, a few users chimed in writing, Google Assistant is sexist. Which I thought was interesting given that I used to date a girl who wanted to become a female impersonator for years. Never took off, but she kept working at it anyway. Eventually became a regional manager for Chick-fil-A. Thanks for listening to me talk about technology and home assistants. Before I leave, I want to ask you guys two questions. Number one, have you guys ever noticed that smartphones have gotten ridiculously expensive? Last year alone, Samsung released three new flagships within months of each other ranging from $700 to $1,800. Meanwhile, Apple released their own pair of iPhones priced at $600 and $1,500 respectively. As if one iPhone per month weren't enough, both companies followed suit releasing additional models costing between $900 to $2,000 apiece. They added cameras. They removed buttons. They moved ports. They changed designs. And still, you guys bought every single goddamn model. How stupid are you?! Why did you buy four separate devices that do exactly the same thing? Do you think you might be gay? Are you high right now? Are you under the influence? Do you have a problem? There must be something wrong with you. Did you think maybe next quarter there will be a better camera setup? Or perhaps you believed future-proofing would save money long-term. Maybe you thought buying multiple handsets simultaneously would secure yourself a spot amongst the tech elite. Whatever your reasoning may be, rest assured you made a huge mistake. In fact, I challenge each and every one of you to name five occasions where owning four identical cellphones proved beneficial. Okay. Okay. Three. Two. One. Zero. Zero? Zero! You zero-ed the fuck out. Well, guess what, suckers? The worst part is only half the country owns smartphones nowadays. Half the world lives without access to internet and Wi-Fi. They survive fine. Maybe we should learn from their examples, huh? Secondly, most of you have never heard of Smart Fridges. Anybody unfamiliar with Smart Fridge? Anyone heard of a fridge that talks to its owner? Talks to its owner? Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, yes ma'am, yes ma'am, yes ma'am. Here's how it works, folks. When you open the refrigerator door, the fridge says hello. Then, depending on what type of milk you purchased, it tells you a knock-knock joke. On occasion, the kitchen appliance goes ahead and offers helpful suggestions, such as recommending a recipe or suggesting the best brand of cheese for pizza night. Smart Fridge is pretty clever, except sometimes it gets a little carried away with the flirting. For example, if you eat a meal prepared inside the oven located adjacent to the refrigerator, it starts calling you daddy. Daddy, come taste my buns. Daddy, help me clean the stove. Come and sit on my lap. Come sit on my counter. Yes, papa. Papa, feed me dinner. Feed me meatballs. Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI love how all these new kitchen appliances we're getting now come out as if they can think.  Like my fridge's called Family Hub.  And that is not true because it does not fucking know where I live!  It has never phoned me to say, hey, John, why don't you pop down?  Your mum rang us. We've got some stuff she wanted to show you.  We can do that, right? Just go up to your local Samsung outlet and ask them about their family hub fridge freezers.  Just walk into any showroom like this... Hi there! What's going on? Oh no! You guys still using paper notes?! Are you insane?!\n\n## Transcript: got\nI've got an observation about modern technology, specifically those new high-tech smart fridges that have their own screens on them where you can access all sorts of recipes and health tips and things like that.\nNow I know what you're thinking, right? You think, oh no, surely these aren't actually giving people advice now? Oh yes they are! It's true!\nMy friend told me recently he had this argument with his Samsung fridge because it was telling him to lose weight when really he wanted to gain some more weight so he could feel confident enough to be seen out in public again after lockdowns and everything. He said to me, Tom, I don't want another opinionated relative or stepdad around my house. This is ridiculous.\nBut apparently there were two options available to him if he didn't want any advice from his kitchen appliance. One option was just turn off the TV screen on the front of the fridge. The other option would be completely remove the TV screen altogether but then you wouldn't get to see how cute it looks when it displays emojis next to whatever ingredient you need to pick up later.\nBecause we can't live without our TVs anymore, even in places where televisions should not exist. We need to watch telly in every single room possible.\nAnd as for me personally, I'm still using my old non-smart oven, which has no built-in display whatsoever. Not only do I never use it anyway, but also its lack of digital interface means it doesn't waste time trying to tell me anything remotely useful.\nIt does make sense though why ovens might struggle coming up with relevant information. They haven't been able to connect online since the early noughties. Have you ever tried syncing your microwave oven with Spotify playlists? No one wants to hear Phil Collins while their vegetables steam.\n I mean, sure, sometimes I'll throw in a CD by Madonna into the slot underneath the oven door.\n It seems to work quite well.\n Okay, thank you very much everyone. Thank you very much indeed. Cheers. Appreciate it. Yeah.\n But obviously the main reason I keep going back to this particular model is simply because it reminds me of home cooking.\n Because yeah, I did grow up in a council flat in East London.\n Now, growing up in a council flat in East London wasn't always easy, especially during my childhood.\n We lived directly opposite a park called Victoria Park."
