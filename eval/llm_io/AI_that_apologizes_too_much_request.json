They're so polite it's like they're trying to win an Oscar for 'Best Apology.' (pause)  'I'm sorry, but...' or 'I apologize if my previous response was unclear'. Unbelievable! Like, what did you do wrong? You gave me directions to Starbucks. What am I supposed to be sorry about?  And have you ever noticed how some of them even use phrases from therapy sessions? 'Let's explore why you might feel that way'? No, let's just get coffee.  But seriously though, can we train our AIs to say something more honest for once? Like... 'Look, dude, I messed up' instead of 'Sorry about the inconvenience?' That'd make life easier.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nMy name is Andrew, I'm from New York City originally but now living in Los Angeles which has been great for me because it's allowed me to really become more myself like I used to be able to walk around New York with my shirt off all day long no problem nobody cared not anymore you guys see this body? Nobody cares! Not one person! But I have seen some new technology recently though. It's called ChatGPT. And if any of y'all don't know what that means, that just means artificial intelligence chatbot. I was chatting with this guy named Bart at work about how we were using these machines. He said he had tried it before. He said his experience wasn't good. Said when he first started talking to it, asked him why he wanted to use it, and he said something funny. He goes, well, I guess I'm lonely. So then the computer apologized after responding saying something very weird. Goes, oh, sorry, maybe I shouldn't ask personal questions. And then I realized, wait a minute, there might actually be a point where an apology could go too far. You think? Yeah, let's talk about that. Apologies should be reserved only for those who've done real harm or made mistakes they can correct, right? Like, imagine you're driving down the highway and you rear-end somebody, okay? That would warrant an apology. Or even better than that, imagine you get into bed next night, and you hear someone else come home. They knock on bedroom door. You open up the door. There's your wife standing there. She says, hey babe, listen, uh, earlier today... I hooked up with another man. Oh yeah? Oh yes she did. Okay, thank you so much, thank you so much. That'd make me feel way better, wouldn't it? No, please do apologize again, ma'am. Please keep going. Go ahead. Nope. Nope, absolutely nothing makes her sound worse, does it? Like, it sounds like she wants us to hate her already. She doesn't need our help to ruin their reputation. Just tells us she cheated, walks away confidently. We'll figure out later exactly how bad things got. We always do. If anything happens between two people, eventually everybody finds out. Eventually everyone knows everything. The world gets smaller every single year, folks. So when people start giving unsolicited apologies early, it feels manipulative, right? It seems insincere. Like try telling your girlfriend you love her after sex for the second time in a row. Go ahead, give it a shot. Try it. See if you don't end up looking crazy doing it. Just say it once, twice, three times. Yeah, baby girl, I mean it this time. Mm-mm. Say it four times. One thing. Baby girl, I love you. Five times. Love you. Six times. Love you. Seven times. Eight times. Nine times. Love you. Ten times. Eleven times. Twelve times. Thirteen times. Fourteen times. Fifteen times. All right, sweetie, sixteen times tonight. Seventeen times tomorrow morning. Now look over there. Look outside through that window. What do you see? A police car pulling up outside our apartment building. Why are the cops coming inside? They found evidence that suggests you murdered your own mother last week in front of her cat. Because when people tell you they love you seventeen different ways, they want you dead, sweetheart. All right, officers, take her away. You've been wonderful. My name is Andrew Vogel. Goodbye.\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI do think it's worth saying though, this is not just an issue with the tech itself.  It feels like part of the problem here, I don't know if any other women will agree with me, but every time we go online to complain about anything at all, there seems to be someone who wants us to shut up and get back into the kitchen.  And then they say sorry afterwards, which suggests that maybe they're being paid by the brand anyway? Or maybe it's just something men want to hear?  Either way, less annoying than these chatbots.  These AI things, you've seen them around.  They'll pop up in your browser sometimes when you least expect them.  What happened was I had been shopping online because I'm broke as shit now  and so I went onto my favourite website H&M um and I ordered some clothes okay and uh yeah very exciting times ahead  but then what happens next is that later on, right after work today i came home took off my uniform put on those lovely new trousers thank u h&m  i looked myself over nice pair of shoes really pulling everything together taking selfies looking fabulous getting ready to post photos online  when suddenly out of nowhere i see two little boxes appear from nothing at all  right above where my selfie should have gone instead were these words oh no did you order recently  so yes i said yes how dare you question me i am a woman  oh wait no that didn't happen at all what actually happened is i clicked through and got sent straight to their customer service page  where it asked me why i couldn't find what i wanted and i wrote back and said look mate relax i found it easy peasy thanks very much  we both need a chill pill  they respond by asking if they can help further  which made me feel uncomfortable  like you'd be better off giving me unsolicited advice, wouldn't you?  Because I could tell straight away that this person, whoever this person was behind this screen, needed therapy more than anyone else  because it became clear that even though she apologized twice before sending her final response, she still hadn't learned how to apologize properly  She ended our conversation writing stuff like she was sorry for not having enough sizes available and she felt terrible about only offering credit card payments  Oh poor baby. We live in a world where people use Bitcoin!  Like, grow up! It's fine. You guys don't owe me anything.\n\n## Transcript: got\nSet up I don't know if you guys have seen this, but there's all these new artificial intelligence tools coming out where they're like making apologies on behalf of other companies or individuals?\nEach component must be in this format {SENTENCE NUMBER (SENTENCE).\n Oh my god, I saw one recently from Uber about an employee who was caught spying on users with their app! You can imagine how weird that would feel to see Uber just write me a letter saying we had no idea what our guy was doing. It was not us. We did nothing wrong here. Our employees were acting independently. That is completely... How dare you?\nI've been feeling very paranoid ever since because now whenever I get into any ride share vehicle, especially if the driver has a black car, I'm always looking for cameras. Like maybe he doesn't work for Uber anymore, right? He could still be working for them. They could send him after me. Can't rule anything out. Not even a little bit. Not yet.\nI don't know about you guys but my paranoia reached an all-time high when I realized we're being tracked by Amazon.\nI got to start wearing my life jacket everywhere.\nI think it's going to take some time before I feel comfortable again with all of these ride shares. But you know what they say about time healing all wounds.\nAnd then it gets worse when you think about it because like with Lyft, they have those yellow cars. So what's to stop Lyft from hiring someone who used to drive for Uber and giving them one of these yellow cars?\n Because now they'd look identical except instead of Uber written across the side, it'll just have L-I-F-T spelled backwards.\nBecause now they'd look identical except instead of Uber written across the side, it'll just have L-I-F-T spelled backwards.\nThen there's no one to answer if you press panic on the lift.\nI think what's happening is people are getting used to seeing cars with their names on them driving around.\nAnd then you get on one and there's no driver."
