Airports that have more outlets than my grandma has grandkids. I mean, it's like they're trying to make up for all those overpriced coffee shops by giving us free power.  I was at LAX last week, and I swear every other chair had an outlet built into it. It's like they knew we'd be so desperate for juice that we'd start charging our phones while sitting on them. 'Sorry about the delay, folks – just give me another minute to charge this thing.'  And don't even get me started on the ones that say 'Power available' next to each seat. Like, who comes across one of these signs and thinks, 'Oh great, now I can finally top off my phone... after paying $12 for a bagel?'  But seriously though, if air travel became a competition based solely on how many outlets per square foot, some airport would win hands down. And then we could put 'Outlet champion of the world' right above their logo.\n\n## Transcript: baseline1\nI love when I go to an airport that has so much power it just kind of spills over into like other areas of the airport, you know? Like there will be these little shops where they sell travel accessories or things for people who get lost at sea but also have free Wi-Fi because why not right like this is exciting i'm gonna take all my clothes off let's do it But then what ends up happening is like women come along and men start going oh she hasn't seen me since we got here don't worry babe if she doesn't find us before boarding call me i'll look after her okay yeah And then you're left on your own which sucks especially if you've been traveling by yourself like this guy looks worried he'd probably be more comfortable getting picked up by his parents again It was really nice though like three years ago flying out of JFK it had one of those airports that just had way too many outlets. The wall would sort of curve around towards you and hit your knee and say hello sir thank you very much now please enjoy some complimentary air conditioning and I remember thinking wow I wonder how much electricity you need to run this entire place They must use a lot of energy to keep everything humming along because of course there were no plug sockets available anywhere else. So obviously I used my laptop while standing next to the luggage carousel while watching everyone elses suitcase spin round in circles being rejected from its home And then eventually someone said something about their missing bag. Do any of y'all remember the last time you flew somewhere? Okay cool. You ever notice that sometimes when you fly places, every single person gets off the plane except for you? That happened to me once recently. It was very weird. And I looked down, I realized I wasn't even plugged in anymore. Because what ended up happening was that every passenger who boarded that flight had taken turns using the outlet near the luggage carousel, including myself. All of them did it. And then none of them paid attention to whether anyone else needed anything. Just took turns hogging it all until finally only I remained uncharged. There should be rules about how long you can hold onto a socket. A good rule of thumb could be whoever uses the socket first, goes first. Or maybe whoever needs the charge most. If you see someone looking frantically around trying to figure out why they still haven't gotten notification yet, give him your phone. Thank you guys so much. Have a great night!\n\n## Transcript: baseline2\nI've been traveling so much lately.  And I'm very excited about this travel thing because it's nice to see that there are still places left where you can go like an asshole.  That is my favorite part. The fact that you could be rude as shit at certain places around the world.  Like, I was recently on a train from New York City into Boston.  Now, if you don't know what we're talking about here, just imagine being trapped inside a subway car during rush hour when one person decides they want to fart right after eating Indian food.  Just imagine that.  So I'm sitting down minding my own business reading the paper  this lady gets up off her seat she walks over towards me i didn't realize i took all those steps now she tapped me on the shoulder she said excuse me may i use your phone?  My name is Joe Henry. My job is not sharing phones!  She did apologize profusely afterwards but...  The only other place besides India... That would make sense.  Because obviously Indians live there.  But no! This airport has more power sockets than the entire country of India combined!  Yeah, I think I'll take their wall outlet situation any day, thank you very much!\n\n## Transcript: got\nSet up to this part of my life, I travel quite a bit.\nI've been doing more traveling recently because I had a baby.\nSo now when you have kids, that's another thing they tell you about having babies is like how much it will change your life.\nAnd I believe them because every time I go anywhere with my daughter who's six months old now she was born on March 1st by the way if you're wondering why her dad isn't really paying attention during sex just didn't happen don't worry about it we got there we did yeah thank you very much i appreciate that um so anyway uh but yeah sometimes when you take infants places especially with other people around you know they can be pretty loud right and they're always looking out for their feelings though which i think is nice but then sometimes those same parents forget about yours or you know like all their friends get together and start talking loudly one after the other no break between conversations what do these adults need to talk so fast like that's kind of crazy you ever notice that oh man i'm getting older i used to love hearing grown men yell into cell phones too um but nowadays whenever any adult yells into their phone even without knowing anything else going on you know something bad has happened that person probably lost someone close to them maybe a loved one died or something worse than that. So... Yeah, sorry dude. Sorry. But also, hey, look over there! There's an airport with only two outlets!\nSettling down has made me super paranoid as well. Like before I would fly from New York to LA all the time. No problem. Now, not anymore. Every flight I take, I feel like, oh shit, what if? What if we crash? We gonna die? You know what I mean?\nSettling down has made me super paranoid as well. Like before I'd fly from New York to L.A., all the time. Not anymore.\nSettling down has made me super paranoid as well. Like before I'd fly from New York to L.A., all the time. Not anymore.\n Like before I could smoke weed and listen to jazz music while flying through security. And now I gotta make sure everything comes off.\n Like before I could smoke weed and listen to jazz music while flying through security. And now I gotta make sure everything comes off.\n Now I'm standing there and TSA lady looks at me and goes, excuse me sir, could you please empty your pockets onto that bin?\n Okay. It sounds weird to say it out loud. That feels condescending. Just asking me questions. Right? She doesn't care about the answer.\n It seems silly to ask somebody whose entire body weight is comprised almost entirely of food whether or not they ate today.\n I never thought twice about this until actually I said this to my friend who works behind the counter at Starbucks, he confirmed this to me.\n He told me he gets asked constantly whether or not his feet smell\n and basically here's how it happens. They want to clean the machine.\n They come up to him, and they're like, hi. Hi. Excuse me, ma'am, I see you working hard. You seem like a dedicated employee."
