"Script:\n\n\"You know what's wild? Toddlers who tell it like it is, right from day one. I mean, my niece was two years old once, she looked at me and said, 'That shirt stinks.' (pause) That's not even an opinion; that's just fact.\n\n\"I've got another friend whose kid told her husband, 'Dad farted.' Now, I'm no expert on toddler etiquette, but isn't there some sort of rule about keeping that kind of information private?\n\n\"And have you ever noticed how kids will give their parents unsolicited advice when they're eating dinner? Like, my sister-in-law's daughter comes over to them, looks down at their plate, and says, 'Grandma needs more vegetables.'\n\n\"But honestly, if someone asked me for life advice now – I'd say be honest with yourself, don't wear socks with sandals... unless you want people laughing behind your back.\"\n\n(cue laughter and applause)"
