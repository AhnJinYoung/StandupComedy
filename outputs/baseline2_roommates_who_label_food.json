They'd go out to lunch together every day, come back and watch TV, you know?\"\n(Punchline): \"And I'm not saying they're gay or anything because, um... You see? Because it's weird if you put your arm around me now, so...\"\n(Callback): \"But when we lived there, it was always, hey! What do you want for dinner tonight, bro?
