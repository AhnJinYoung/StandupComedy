"I was on an office building today, right? I'm going up to my floor. The guy pressed his button first so he's like hello how you doing thanks good just got back from holiday yeah i said what where did you go he went south of france lovely place yeah i thought it was gonna be one of them places that you don't know but instead this man knew exactly which part uh we're talking about here now there is more than two parts down there mate you've been everywhere haven't you?\nWhat were you doing out there? You weren't working or anything, no? No work at all?\nNope! Just enjoying myself. Oh well, enjoy yourself while you can because when the government takes away our pensions, then who knows?\nMy boyfriend lives in London. He works for HMRC. Anyone heard of him? Yeah, they love taxman, don't they?\nHe hates it. And every time I see some guy with a suit on telling me how much money I owe... Ooh!\nBut anyway, if anyone tells you that Britain needs immigrants, tell them to get their own cleaning lady. That'll sort them out.\nAnd before any white people complain, yes, black people clean houses too, okay? It doesn't have to be black women. Black men do housework as well.\nWe do everything else, why not cleaning?\nOh, another thing happened in that lift. Another person came into the lift, had a little look around, looked confused, didn't really say anything until the end when she said...\nExcuse me, excuse me! Is anybody here British? Because I want somebody English speaking.\nBecause I think I need help. We need to talk to someone whose language we understand.\nIt's very interesting isn't it though because sometimes even within countries there are different languages spoken um i feel sorry for those people actually especially the elderly ones cos they're getting older every day without learning new technology\nthey won't adapt they won't change right oh i forgot my pin number again it's the same reason why they keep putting pennies under my pillow after midnight\nbecause they forget what century they live in and they still believe in fairies, don't they?\nDo you ever hear that joke? Do you know the old Irish joke? Well, if I told you I'd have to kill you.\nSo thank you guys very much, take care bye-bye"
