Setup: Because when I was young and dumb, I thought that if there were like an easy way to meet somebody new, then maybe they would be perfect. Setup: And now my friends tell me what happened last week on Tinder? A guy asked how many people did he kill? Setup: Like who is this fucking madman? That's insane! He just comes out with it! Setup: There used to be a time where it wasn't weird or inappropriate to ask someone about their job, but also not everybody works. Setup: People do things. They work odd jobs sometimes.",
