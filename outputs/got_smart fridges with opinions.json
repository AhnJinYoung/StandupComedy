You think, oh no, surely these aren't actually giving people advice now? Oh yes they are! It's true!\nMy friend told me recently he had this argument with his Samsung fridge because it was telling him to lose weight when really he wanted to gain some more weight so he could feel confident enough to be seen out in public again after lockdowns and everything. He said to me, Tom, I don't want another opinionated relative or stepdad around my house. This is ridiculous.\"\nBut apparently there were two options available to him if he didn't want any advice from his kitchen appliance. One option was just turn off the TV screen on the front of the fridge. The other option would be completely remove the TV screen altogether but then you wouldn't get to see how cute it looks when it displays emojis next to whatever ingredient you need to pick up later.\"",
