Or, does anybody know where our CEO lives?\nOr my personal favorite, did anybody else hear about what happened on Monday night when Donald Trump got arrested again? So weird!

Because apparently he has this thing called presidential immunity, which makes me wonder why everybody keeps saying he doesn't read books.\"",
