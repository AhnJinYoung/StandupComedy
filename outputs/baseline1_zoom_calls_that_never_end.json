"I hate Zoom meetings, man. I just do. They make me so tense up before every meeting.\nAnd then they always go on forever because people don't know how to get off of them for some reason. Like you're not allowed to hang out after school anymore or something like it's crazy.\nThe worst is when there's only one person left who hasn't said anything yet but nobody wants to let him talk i'm sorry what was the question again um yeah no i mean uh oh my god yeah thank you guys so much\nlike why did we even schedule this call if everybody already knows everything? Is anybody else sick of these endless zooms?\nLike you've seen those movies where someone gets trapped in a room with an insane killer? You gotta wait till he falls asleep at night.\nWe should all be waiting until the host loses their internet connection.\nThat'd work too good actually.\nThey got rid of open offices now, which makes sense, right? Because people can't focus when other people walk by.\nBut sometimes during the day, especially around lunchtime, people will come into our rooms, break down the walls, and say stuff like, hey, team, has anyone tried any new restaurants lately?\nOr, what kind of wine do you prefer?\nWhat kind of wine do you prefer? Are you dry? Or sweet?\nIt's interesting that you ask because recently I became aware that red wine is made from grapes while white wine is made from ice cubes.\nYes, that is correct. And we think of ice cube trays as disposable products, but really they could last us many years if we reuse them responsibly.\nThank you very much. I appreciate it. That'll help cut back on waste.\nDo you want more questions later on today about sustainability issues affecting the planet earth, such as plastic bags versus paper bags or straws made of metal versus straws made of glass?"
