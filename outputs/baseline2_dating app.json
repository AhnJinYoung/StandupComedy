Yes! Thank you so much!\"\n(Callback): \"Thank you so much. My name is Ali Sadiq. I am gay as fuck.\"\n(Setup): \"And if your sexual preference is not one of these three letters, then we don't got shit to talk about right now\"\n(Incongruity): \"But that being said uh i live my life pretty openly as an openly gay man which means people see me all over town like restaurants bars whatever\"\n(Punchline): \"and sometimes they'll come up to me and be like hey mister why'd god make you gay um because he wanted somebody around to clean his house but also he was bored.\"\n(Setup): \"That's how God works. That's how God created us.\"\n(Incongruity): \"He gets bored at night. He makes new stuff. You know what? It doesn't matter.\"\n(Punchline): \"It's okay. We're here.
