"Oh my god, guys, I love going to the gym so much! You know what's really fun? Gym influencer videos where they film themselves at every step of their workout?\nLike, you ever see those Instagram Reels? Where it just starts on them doing bicep curls with a caption that says something like, morning motivation!\nAnd then mid-reel, it cuts to them deadlifts, but now the caption is like, oh no, what am I gonna do for lunch today?\nNo! Then there'll be another cut later on in the reel, this time it will be an overhead shot of them running on one of these giant treadmills while eating chicken salad out of a bowl.\nThis time the caption might say something more ominous like, why did I sign up for CrossFit again?\nThen finally towards the end of the video there's always some kind of reveal or punchline where maybe if we're lucky she pulls back her shirt and shows us all her abs.\nOr better yet, he drops his pants right down to his ankles and reveals to us that yes indeed he does have a penis after all.\nIt looks small compared to his personality though. That shit must be cold.\nI don't get how people watch other humans exercise, you know?\nThat seems like such a weird thing to watch someone else do.\nWeirdly enough, even weirder than watching somebody work out, is when they give themselves commentary during said workout.\nWhere it sounds less like sports commentary and more like just regular old person-to-person conversation about nothing at all.\nFor example, imagine being on the subway and seeing a guy sitting across from you staring into space looking very concerned.\nHe leans over to you and whispers something shocking in your ear like, hey buddy, can you believe Kanye West was almost president once upon a time?\nCan you wrap your head around that level of gravitas?\nThere's also sometimes it feels like gym influencer reels are trying to convince me to go to the gym too by making it sound like the most relaxing place on earth.\nLike it's not the same vibe if it's just you versus everybody who watches Fitness YouTube.\nBut yeah, that'd be cool. Maybe next time I'm free I should join him for a deadlift.\nWhat do you think? Would that be nice? Or would that be super awkward? Like if I showed up uninvited to his apartment, I guess i could bring wine.\nWouldn't want things to feel too tense.\nHow long do you usually keep the camera rolling before turning off the lights and having sex?\nIs that allowed? Is anybody stopping you? No, seriously, stop recording. Put that away.\nStop laughing, put that phone away.\nPut that recorder away.\nTurn that microphone off.\nCome closer. Let me whisper something in your ear.\nIf you need any tips, I've got plenty.\nOkay? The world needs fewer people.\nThe planet's overcrowded. We gotta thin the herd.\nJust take yourself outside behind a tree and shoot yourself in the fucking face.\nWhoever invented guns deserves our deepest gratitude because holy fuck.\nThank you so much for listening to me talk.\nGood night!"
