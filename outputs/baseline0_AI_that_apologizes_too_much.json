"Script:\n\n\"You know, I've been noticing this trend with these new AI assistants everyone's got. They're so polite it's like they're trying to win an Oscar for 'Best Apology.' (pause) \n'I'm sorry, but...' or 'I apologize if my previous response was unclear'. Unbelievable! Like, what did you do wrong? You gave me directions to Starbucks. What am I supposed to be sorry about?\n\nAnd have you ever noticed how some of them even use phrases from therapy sessions? 'Let's explore why you might feel that way'? No, let's just get coffee.\n\nBut seriously though, can we train our AIs to say something more honest for once? Like... 'Look, dude, I messed up' instead of 'Sorry about the inconvenience?' That'd make life easier.\""
