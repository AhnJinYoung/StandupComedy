"I'm so glad to be back doing live shows, because Zoom is fun but it does have its downsides.\nOne of them being you can't really do any drinking on Zoom, right?\nBecause if I was at this venue now, that would just be part of my job, yeah? Just got to get hammered every night, innit?\nBut not when I'm on Zoom, no.\nIf anything happens while we're on there, what's going to happen? That's all I've thought about today.\nLike, what if someone comes through the window?\nWhat am I supposed to do? Call security like, hey man, help! Someone's coming into my house!\nThey'll be like, whoa, hang tight sir. Where are you located again?\nThat guy in the background shouting out, put him on speakerphone!\nPut him on speakerphone!\nSo...\nYeah... No one wants to see me naked.\nThat'd ruin their day, wouldn't it?\nMy face pops up, everyone goes, oh no.\nNot another one.\nIt doesn't matter where I am or how far away from home I am.\nWhen people think of England they still go, London.\nEveryone thinks of England, London.\nAnd even then some people say Manchester, which pisses us off, obviously.\nWe know it exists though, thank you very much.\nNo one gives Birmingham an honourable mention for whatever reason.\nEven people in Wales don't give it a shout-out.\nPeople always talk about the two cities, right?\nLondon, New York City.\nThe rest of the world seems to love comparing those two places together.\nThey seem to want to compare the two cultures side by side.\nNew Yorkers will often complain about how crazy our transport system is over there.\nAnd we might hear that sometimes.\nJust ignore them, mate.\nDon't let them wind you up.\nCos deep down inside, everyone knows it could never actually work properly.\nCan you imagine trying to run the tube during rush hour with American efficiency?\nImagine hearing announcements come over saying things like, ladies and gentlemen, good morning, welcome aboard.\nPlease make sure your doors open and close completely before boarding the train safely behind me.\nGood afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\nWelcome aboard.\nPlease mind the gap between yourself and the stranger sitting next to you.\nMind the gap between yourself and the stranger sitting next to you.\nLadies and gentleman, please keep your arms inside the carriage at all times.\nThank you so much.\nHave a great journey ahead of you.\nHello, hello.\nHow are you guys feeling after last week?\nVery excited for tonight.\nI feel fantastic.\nExcellent energy in the room already.\nGreat to see everybody smiling and enjoying themselves.\nSomebody told me recently he had seen my name written on something called Office Bingo Card.\nApparently Office Bingo Cards were popular online during lockdown, especially during video conferences.\nYes, apparently these cards feature phrases commonly used in virtual meetings such as nice to meet you and that kind of thing.\nAny idea why anyone would create such a card?\nWhy anyone would use such a product?\nWell, I think it's probably safe to assume most users aren't looking forward to attending these conference calls.\nMaybe they find it boring listening to other people drone on and on.\nOr maybe they hate meeting new colleagues and dread having to chat to them afterwards.\nWhatever their reasons may be, they've created Office Bingo, hoping to liven things up slightly, right?\nBy marking down each time they heard certain catchphrases, until eventually somebody said something outrageous enough to win them the game.\nSounds exciting, isn't it?\nNow, if only life wasn't quite so dull.\nOffice Bingo sounds perfect for office workers stuck working from home.\nCouldn't agree more.\nHere's a phrase, ladies and gentlemen, if you ever need one, a little something i came up with myself specifically designed for office zoom bingo.\nI present to you ladies and gentlemen, bottom half of the screen, top half of the call.\nThat should be enough to get you started on your way to winning big.\nHope you enjoyed it.\nCheers, thanks very much."
