"I'm from LA originally, which is interesting because I look like this now.\nBut growing up my parents were Mexican immigrants so they wanted to raise me in Spanish but at one point we just got lazy so instead of speaking English with them i would speak spanish to them but then switch to english when it was convenient for me.\nSo if you ever want to hear that conversation play a game of catch me if you can with me.\nAnd sometimes what happens too is people will get confused about where my accent comes from or how do I sound American?\nBecause on paper I don't make sense right? Like culturally I have no idea who Taylor Swift is, but grammatically I am correct every time.\nI feel like I should be teaching ESL somewhere, you know?\nBut I think part of why I started doing accents though was to help hide my own voice.\nLike whenever I try to sing, I end up sounding like a bunch of dogs having sex together, honestly.\nIt's very unsettling.\nMy friends tell me, oh, Drew, you gotta work out more. You've been working out less than any other comic in the room tonight.\nYeah, yeah. And I say, well, maybe if y'all stopped laughing all the time, I could afford to go back to CrossFit, okay?\nThis isn't an excuse. It's not my fault that I'm only two-thirds muscle by volume.\nA lot of times I'll get mad at myself after shows like this.\nIf the set doesn't land, I hate going home afterwards feeling sad about myself.\nWhat bothers me most, actually, is when somebody tells me after a show something along these lines...\nThey're like, man, you really opened yourself up emotionally on stage.\nThank you so much. Yeah, you guys really made me cry.\nOh, thank God! Oh, I need that.\nWhich makes me realize... I shouldn't open up on stage!\nNo wonder nobody laughed during that last joke.\nI literally said, hey everybody, let's all hug each other.\nLet's become new besties.\nThat is the dumbest shit I've ever said.\nWhy did I do that?\nEvery single person in this room has better things to do than watch some dude talk about himself before midnight.\nDon't clap for that nonsense.\nNow put those hands down.\nWe are at capacity.\nThe fire marshal told us to stop letting strangers touch one another.\nStop touching.\nNot yet.\nOkay.\nSorry.\nHey, there's a couple dudes backstage.\nThere's also a woman.\nShe's fine looking.\nShe looks good.\nShe's hot.\nAnd she wants to come out.\nShe's scared.\nShe won't leave her dressing room.\nDo anybody want her to come out?\nEverybody in unison says yes.\nGreat.\nGood to see that we still believe in love, huh?\nEveryone agrees.\nWe're all horny losers.\nEven him over there.\nHe thinks he hates dating apps, but deep inside he loves his phone more than anything else in life.\nWe're all horned loser assholes.\nAnyway, she's coming out.\nHere she goes.\nHi everyone.\nWelcome to This Is Not Happening.\nI'm your host, Roy Wood Jr., Comedy Central presents, This Is Not Happening.\nEach week on our podcast, This Is Not Happening, we dive into the lives of comedians, actors, musicians, writers, athletes, anyone who works hard enough to earn their living off their talent rather than their personality.\nTonight, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Punch Line Comedy Club in New York City, Comedy Central presents...
