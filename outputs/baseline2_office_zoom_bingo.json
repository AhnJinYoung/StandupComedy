"(Setup): \"I got this card from my friend who's an artist.\"\n(Incongruity): \"She made it herself because she was bored at work during lockdown when we were all doing Zoom meetings.\"\n(Punchline): \"And I think that's really funny if you're sitting there thinking about how much effort went into making one piece of paper look like another.\"\n(Callback): \"But then she sent me these cards to play Bingo with her online while we both worked remotely.\"\n(Setup): \"And so now every day before our meeting starts, I print out a new sheet.\"\n(Incongruity): \"It looks different every time. You know? Like today, just three boxes going horizontal.\"\n(Punchline): \"Like what is happening here?\"\n(Callback): \"What kind of person comes up with this shit?\"\n(Setup): \"But...
