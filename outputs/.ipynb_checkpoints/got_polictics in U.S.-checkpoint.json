Like, I don't know how Donald Trump did it, because he's never had any experience or anything before, but he went through so much shit with his family business and then reality TV.\nAnd then he was just ready for president? Like, what happened there? Because no one else could have gone through everything that he went through during those two years and come out looking better on television than Hillary Clinton.\nLike she didn't even get her own scripted show! What is happening?! It bums me out though, because we need more women in power right now. And especially black people, because white dudes are getting too many opportunities, honestly.\"",
