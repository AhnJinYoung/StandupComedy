"Script:\n\n\"You know, have you ever noticed how our parents suddenly became experts on emojis? (pauses) Like they've been practicing for years.\n\n'I'm sending a smiling face'... no, mom, that's just a 😊 – it doesn't mean 'I love your cooking.' It means I don't want to be there anymore.\n\nAnd then there's dad with his 🤣. You're not funny; that was just a fart joke from last night's dinner. Stop trying to relate!\n\nBut my favorite is when they send a 👍. What does that even mean? 'Good job'? No, dad, that's just a thumbs up from a beer commercial.\n\nWe should start an emoji support group for confused kids like me.\""
