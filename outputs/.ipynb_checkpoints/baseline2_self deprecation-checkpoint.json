"I used to work at McDonald's for five years, which is actually how I got my own apartment.\nThank you so much. This is nice. Thank you guys very much. Yeah, that was great. That was really good. You know what? If anything, this whole COVID thing has taught me one thing about myself.\nIt's like, fuck it, I'm gonna do drugs now. And if there were ever any silver linings of quarantine or lockdowns, it'd be like, oh yeah, cocaine makes all these Zoom meetings go by way faster than they should have.\nSo we'll see where that goes. Like I don't know man like uh i've never done coke before but um i did watch an entire season of stranger things on netflix in three days though so maybe not just coke right i mean no no because when you think about it coke would make more sense wouldn't it if you wanted to binge-watch something?\nLike take some coke and then watch Stranger Things. Or even better idea, listen to eight albums back-to-back while taking ecstasy. Because Ecstasy will get you through those bonus tracks.\nBut Coke will help you finish a show with an unsatisfying cliffhanger ending. Oh! My God!\nThat being said, let me tell you who I can relate to, besides Ellen DeGeneres, the only person from Hollywood that I could really relate to during the whole pandemic was Meryl Streep.\nShe's been acting since she was nine years old. She has over 70 films under her belt. At least four people want to kill her every day. But still somehow managed to live her life without doing hard drugs once.\nOh! What a fucking legend! Right? It boggles the mind doesn't it? The woman must have ice water flowing through her veins instead of blood because...\nIf anyone knows how many times I almost overdosed behind the counter at McDonald's after getting high, they're going to call the police right now.\nAnd I appreciate that, thank you. I appreciate that greatly, sir. Yes, yes, please do.\nCall them. Call them immediately. Tell them Kevin... I didn't even give you his last name yet.\nTell them everything. Everything he told you tonight. Every single word, verbatim. Just throw him out front. They can handle it.\nYeah, come arrest me. Come arrest me. Let me die among strangers. Do it! For sure.\nDon't care anymore. Don't worry about it.\nWhat happened was I started smoking weed too much around that time. Weed made me lazy. So I stopped working out completely.\nI went from exercising every other day to watching documentaries about fat dudes lifting weights at home.\nRight? Which is true. There's this documentary series called Fatbangers. Have you seen it? No? Good choice.\nBecause you shouldn't waste two hours of your precious time on it. Not worth it. Unless you enjoy seeing fat dudes lift weights at their homes.\nThen go ahead. Go ahead and watch it. Waste another hour of your precious time.\nNo thanks. All right? Whatever. Okay, moving forward. Moving forward. Moving forward.\nAll right. Look, look. Listen up, everybody. Everybody sit down. Quiet down. Stop talking. Shh-shh. Okay? Get quiet real quick.\nStop yapping. Shut up! Say less. Less noise! Silence! Hush! Peaceful! Calmness! Tranquility!\nTranquil silence. Total peace. Now say hello again together with me.\nHello! Hello! Hello! See? Much quieter now isn't it? Much calmer? Nice and peaceful in here huh okay well anyway i guess what i am trying to say is that uh i miss performing comedy for sure that's why i kind of miss living in new york city where i perform comedy most nights because you know i love new york city\ni grew up here i lived here for six years had fun had the best time of my life there you know met amazing friends fell in love became successful broke up and moved away\nbut um i wish they didn't have such strict rules for comedians you know like i wish you could still smoke crack backstage at Comedy Central shows because i feel like you need that edge sometimes you know like to get your material ready and stuff\nit might sound crazy but it does help trust me it helps a lot especially if you're writing for kids' TV right because nothing gets you laughing harder than hearing yourself talk afterwards hey harry remember when you smoked crack off stage today holy shit yeah dude that was wild i knew we needed to rewrite the skits so we took the n-word out of episode seven and put biggie in its place instead i hope that works sounds good to me bro it definitely feels different\nthat being said i do wanna move back to new york i do i genuinely believe that i could thrive there if given the opportunity to try again so far i haven't worked up enough courage to buy a ticket just yet but i promise you i will soon very soon very soon uh i do plan to stay in los angeles full-time for the rest of my career but i want to have a second home somewhere else you know and hopefully it won't be seattle either okay but i'm open-minded i'll consider anywhere i'll keep an eye out wherever i travel next you know i always hear rumors whenever celebrities die whether it's kurt cobain, Heath Ledger, Robin Williams, or Michael Jackson.\nWhenever someone dies, everyone comes out of nowhere saying the same phrase.
