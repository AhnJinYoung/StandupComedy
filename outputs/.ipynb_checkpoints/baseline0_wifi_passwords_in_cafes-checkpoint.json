"Script: You know what's wild about going to a café? They always have these super-long, nonsensical WiFi password requirements – like they're trying to filter out anyone who doesn't own a dictionary. \"Welcome_to_Our_Independent_Coffee_Shop\" or something like that.\n\nAnd then you see people just typing away, like they're solving world hunger instead of getting their coffee. I'm pretty sure my grandma could crack those codes if she had an iPhone. It's like, 'Grandma, can you figure this out?' And she'd be all, 'What's a QR code?'\n\nI swear, some places put so many numbers in there; it's like they want us to get lost forever on Google Translate, thinking we need a degree in cryptography just to order a latte online. Can someone please make a password generator for coffee shops? Like, generate me something easy... maybe 'coffee' would do? That way, everyone wins!"
