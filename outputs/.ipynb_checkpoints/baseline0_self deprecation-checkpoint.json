"Script: You know what they say, \"laughter is the best medicine.\" Unless you have health insurance that covers therapy sessions – then just go to therapy. (pause)\n\nI was at my friend's wedding last week, and I saw an old high school photo of myself on their guestbook page. Let me tell you, it looked like I had been hit by a truck... or maybe two trucks. (chuckle) My hair was so big back then; I'm pretty sure I needed a ladder to get into our family car.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on my dance moves. At this same wedding, someone asked if I wanted to take them out for some '90s trivia night drinks after dinner. When we got there, people thought I was there to DJ because everyone around us knew every song from the Spice Girls' discography better than anyone else at the table. Who needs talent when you can just memorize lyrics? \n\nBut seriously though, folks, being single has its perks – free Netflix passwords forever! (laugh) Just kidding; I think most exes would kill me for using those logins still."
