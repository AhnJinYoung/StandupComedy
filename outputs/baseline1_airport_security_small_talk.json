"I was at JFK Airport recently, they were doing that thing where you walk through the metal detector or you can put your stuff on the table for them to pat down, right?\nAnd I'm just looking around thinking about how weird it is that we all know what's going to happen next.\nLike no one's surprised anymore when you go through an airport security line because there will always be some point during that process where someone says something ridiculous out loud and then everyone else has to agree with him before he feels comfortable continuing on his way.\nRight? Like, every single time without fail.\nSo I get up there, my phone comes off of my belt buckle, which isn't even allowed now by TSA regulations so...\nBut whatever... And she looks me dead in the eyes like this and goes, Mr. Smith, do you have any sharp objects in your luggage?\nAnd I look back her straight faced like this and went, no ma'am i don't think anything could survive that journey.\nThat's how bad a job I am at being confident.\nIt would've been easier if I had done cocaine.\nThen I'd be over here like, nah bro, nothing.\nJust a little piece of chalk.\nShe didn't believe me either."
