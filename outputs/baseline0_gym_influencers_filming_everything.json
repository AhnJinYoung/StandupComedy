"Script: You know who's really giving me FOMO? Gym influencers on Instagram, that's who! They're always posting these super-cut videos of themselves doing squats or deadlifts... but what they don't show you is when their phones die after three reps (laughs). \n\nI mean, have you seen those 'before-and-after' transformation vids? The before part usually looks like someone took a selfie with one eye closed while running from an existential crisis – \"Is this all there is?\" And then, boom! After six months of intense exercising and meal prepping, it turns into, \"Oh look at my abs!\" I'm just over here thinking about how much protein powder was involved.\n\nAnd let's talk about those obligatory workout selfies where everyone smiles for the camera mid-set? It's either because they've got some sweet new fitness gear to promote or they genuinely believe the only thing more important than getting gains is looking good while sweating (laughs).\n\nBut honestly, if we could see behind-the-scenes footage of gym influencers actually working out without filters, highlight reels, and #gains goals, maybe I'd be inspired too. Just saying."
