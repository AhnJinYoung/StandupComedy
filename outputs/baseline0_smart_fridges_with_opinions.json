"Script: You know what's wild? We're living in an era where our appliances have more personality than some of my relatives. I mean, who needs human interaction when you've got a fridge that thinks it's funny?\n\nI was trying to get something out of mine last week, but instead of just dispensing ice or whatever, this thing starts talking to me like we're old friends. \"Hey buddy, why so cold?\" It's like, dude, I'm trying to chill some beers in here.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on its'motivational' messages. My fridge is always saying things like, \"You can do better!\" or \"Eat fresh today.\" Like, okay refrigerator, thanks for the life advice. But honestly, if I wanted to hear from someone with such great taste – pun intended – I'd invite myself over to Gordon Ramsay's place.\n\nBut seriously though, who thought this was a good idea? Smart fridges... because what could possibly go wrong with giving household devices personal traits? Maybe next, they'll start judging us based on how many leftovers we leave inside them. (pauses) That would be a real concern!\n\nAll jokes aside, folks, maybe these smart home gadgets will become sentient one day... but until then, let's keep laughing at their sass! Because trust me, my friend, no matter how much data they collect about us, there's still nothing quite like having a bad relationship with technology."
