And sometimes they just kind of bleed into each other, right?\nSetup: The first one is like an hour long, then another one comes along three hours later, and it's like nine o'clock now, we're still on the third call.\nSetup: It gets really weird because everyone knows how much time has passed by now but nobody wants to admit it out loud so instead what happens is people start making these very specific noises during meetings to let everybody else know when enough was enough.\nSetup: You ever notice that? Like someone will be talking about tax returns or whatever, and suddenly there'll be a big fart sound coming from somewhere. Or somebody will get up and walk away and then come back with some snacks.\nSetup: Now you have to wait two more minutes before you can leave. Because if you don't, the person who called the meeting might think that you left too early last week. That happened!",

She would say stuff like, well, Bob, why do you keep telling our team to put their shirts back on?\nOr, hey, look again! This picture of yours reminds me that we need to go fishing soon!\nSo...
