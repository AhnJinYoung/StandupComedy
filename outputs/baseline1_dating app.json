"My friends keep telling me that I need to get back out there, which is nice, but also kind of annoying because it's like they're saying my pussy's going stale or something.\nI'm not on Grindr anymore though because every guy says the same thing about their dick.\nThey'll be like, oh man you can put whatever size condom on me. It doesn't even matter.\nAnd then when we fuck, it feels exactly like putting on a winter coat.\nJust gets tighter with each passing moment until eventually I have no choice but to leave the house naked.\nAlso everyone always asks how big I am these days too, so yeah... Yeah...\nBut honestly, if anything happens now, let people know that I was just taking medicine for gout.\nYeah, so uh... Just got out of one relationship, actually, pretty recently.\nIt lasted three years. We were together for two months before he proposed.\nHe's really sweet, so I said yes.\nThat whole year leading up to our wedding day where we would walk around holding hands, smiling at strangers, laughing at kids' jokes, feeling happy all the time.\nThen finally after nearly an entire lifetime of happiness together we tied the knot and I became Mrs. Mr.\nThe other night while watching TV I realized that without her last name, I don't exist.\nLike she has this family history.\nShe comes from some very old moneyed white families who fought in wars against Native Americans, and my side of things?\nAll my dads ever did was work at KFC.\nSo thank you so much for coming to this show tonight! You've made my dreams come true!\nOkay? Yes, okay! Thank you guys so much! Goodbye forever!"
