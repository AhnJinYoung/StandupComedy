You know what I mean?\"\n(Callback): \"Like when they just squirt out all that milk at once and then pour it into your cup so there's some extra milk right here in the corner where no one else can see it but you get to enjoy it\"\n(Setup): \"And if you're lucky enough to order their fancy drink like a latte macchiato whatever that means...\"\n(Incongruity): \"...then you gotta pay $10 more dollars than everyone else who ordered regular old black coffee because that's how much they charge you per layer of froth that you want.\"\n(Punchline): \"It's insane!\"\n(Setup): \"Now, I live near Starbucks because my dad works here every day at this Starbucks.\"\n(Incongruity): \"So we go there together sometimes.
