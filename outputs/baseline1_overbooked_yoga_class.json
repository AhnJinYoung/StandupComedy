"I was really excited to go to this hot yoga class, because I love doing stuff where people tell me what temperature to make my body feel like it's on fire for no reason.\nThat is so fun! It makes you want to do more shit!\nSo... So I walk into class early, because that's part of the deal when they're going to put all these other sweaty people around me who also did not need this.\nAnd she starts handing out blocks and straps. And if you don't know, those things are made from natural rubber or foam, but they will still get scalding hot inside of your vagina.\nThey'll melt there and then dry up and become a raisin.\nSo now we have six fucking straws just sitting here at our feet?\nHow about one per person? One straw per person.\nWe can use them right away.\nShe hands me two blocks instead of a strap and looks confused by her own decision.\nYeah, fuck yeah! This should be good! Two blocks! Let's get weird with this blocky business!\nAll right, let's see how many different ways I could hold a rock while being naked outside.\nLet's figure some shit out here real quick!\nThen before I even start sweating, we gotta wait another ten minutes for three people.\nNow I'm gonna call them latecomers, but technically none of us were on time for anything today except maybe brunch last week, but...\nAlso, she said we couldn't eat before coming here, which isn't true, and that would actually help keep me cool.\nBut she didn't say we couldn't drink.\nIf you think about it, drinking water is hydration and eating food is nourishment, but both can cause stomach discomfort, making an already awkward pose worse.\nIt doesn't take a genius to realize why alcoholics never stop drinking.\nBecause sometimes after a few drinks, you might notice something unexpected.\nLike the way your face changes shape.\nOr maybe even how much bigger everything else appears compared to your face.\nOh man, I wish I had a drink!\nIs anyone thirsty in here? Anyone wanna talk? Anybody having trouble getting into their legs?\nAnyone else wondering how old the dude who invented yoga must have been when he came up with this thing?\nWhen he first started thinking through poses, he'd probably sit cross-legged on his bed and go, hmm, what if I bend forward?\nWhat if I stretch back behind myself? What if I stick each leg straight up towards heaven?\nNope. That's too far. Nope. Too high.\nJust kinda bend my knees and reach down towards the ground.\nYep. Okay. Now breathe deeply and focus inwardly upon your soul.\nUh-uh, nope. Not yet. Just kinda lean to one side and look at the wall.\nOkay. Maybe later. Breathe deep and focus inward.\nOne day he got bored and went, oh boy, what if I stuck each arm straight out beside myself?\nHmm. Too long. Hmm, okay, cut it in half.\nBend them elbows. No, no, no, pointier than that.\nPointiest of points ever.\nGotta fold them arms in against my body, otherwise I look like a bird trying to fly backwards.\nMaybe next year.\nAnyway, I've decided that every time someone asks me to come to a yoga class again, I'm gonna pretend I heard them ask me to play basketball instead.\nDo you want to play ball? Yeah, sure, doggy-dog, game on!\nBring it on, bitch! Bring it on! You better bring it! You better bring it! Or whatever sports bros say when they want to fight.\nAnyways, I am super bad at playing basketball.\nI only mention that because everyone seems to assume that because I'm very short, I'm somehow naturally athletic.\nWhich isn't true. In fact, most little kids aren't athletically gifted until they hit puberty, at which point they suddenly turn into tiny muscle bound versions of themselves.\nAt least that's kind of what happened to boys.\nAs girls matured, however, their bodies typically shifted sideways.\nFor example, when I was growing up, you'd often find me at recess hiding under a bench waiting for nobody to pick me.\nMy dream was always to grow up big and strong enough to lift heavy objects off children smaller than myself without hurting anybody.\nUnfortunately, that never worked out, but... But I guess I did end up pretty small.\nSmall enough that I haven't gone through puberty once.\nStill happening daily.\nThis has been Bob Odenkirk. Thank you guys. Have a great night. Bye-bye."
