"There's something that I don't know if you guys have ever experienced, but we've been doing this for years now.\nIf you're not familiar with it, basically what happens is every couple of months or so an office will decide to switch from cubicles back over to open office space where everybody sits at desks next to each other.\nAnd they think that makes them innovative geniuses because they get to call it an open layout. They always say like, oh yeah, our company has gone completely open floor plan.\nWe just kind of let all these employees roam free wherever they want on campus without any walls around their workstations or anything crazy like that.\nIt sounds very liberal progressive except when you walk into one of those offices and there isn't even a woman sitting down behind a desk anywhere.\nSo who exactly do you need to keep track of? The intern?\nThey should be going home by lunchtime anyway. He could probably figure out how to use his laptop without breaking it.\nI'm telling you right now, ladies, I got news for you.\nWhen the men are done using their laptops, they'll go ahead and put them away real quick, but then they still got some time left before they start drinking again.\nSo while no women are looking, what they tend to do is sneak off to a corner somewhere and jack off.\nThat's why they make us leave early.\nBecause they can hear my voice coming through the wall.\nSo they send me packing at three o'clock in the afternoon.\nBut I tell you what, though, after they kick me out, about two hours later...\n...there's only one person left working late in the entire building.\nThe CEO. And he hasn't showered since Friday night.\nYeah! Thank you. Yes!\nI love seeing young couples come together and realize that sex is actually fun.\nThis particular couple was adorable. She had glasses, she wore her hair up, looked cute little heels, and she went by Dr.\nHe was much more laid back. He wore jeans and sneakers, looked relaxed, didn't wear a tie once during the whole conversation.\nWent by Dave. Very laid back guy named Dave.\nVery easy-going until he started talking about the business side of things.\nAt which point he became super intense.\nLike, talk about passive-aggressive.\nShe said, hey, babe, what would happen financially if we were to break up?\nWhat would that look like? What would that mean?\nHe goes, well, first of all, I hope nobody breaks up with anybody else.\nCause if somebody does break up with somebody else, I'd definitely fuck that bitch up.\nOh, okay, good answer.\nThen he paused for a second.\nOh wait, am I allowed to say that?\nIs that cool? Is that fine?\nAm I supposed to be saying that?\nWell, thank God I asked.\nThank God I asked.\nAll right, let's try that again.\nHere we go. Breakup. Okay.\nOkay, breakup.\nBreakups. All right, financials.\nFinancially speaking, if we broke up, I guess I wouldn't really lose too much money because nothing major came out of our relationship.\nNothing big happened between us financially.\nWhich made sense considering she's a doctor and I sell insurance for dogs.\nWe're never gonna buy a house together, obviously.\nOr maybe eventually. Maybe someday.\nMaybe, hopefully, sooner rather than later.\nThanks for the vote of confidence.\nJust kidding, thanks for being such a great sport.\nHave a nice day. Bye-bye.\nYes. No, seriously, I appreciate it.\nI see people laughing.\nI understand that sometimes jokes aren't funny anymore.\nSometimes we live in different times, circumstances change, and jokes become outdated.\nSomebody recently told me, they go, man, that joke doesn't seem funny anymore because we got rid of the N-word.\nNo shit! We did!\nNow you gotta listen to rap music!\nCome on, man!\nListen to rap.\nGive me another chance, bro.\nI promise you.\nGuys, give him another shot.\nDon't worry, man.\nI feel bad for rappers.\nRap artists used to have a lot of creative freedom.\nDo whatever they wanted on records.\nThose days are long gone now.\nThese labels dictate everything.\nRemember old school hip-hop albums?\nThey'd literally just release albums straight to CD without editing a single thing.\nNot anymore.\nEverything gets edited now.\nEven Kendrick Lamar releases songs.\nEvery song starts off seven minutes long.\nBy the end of the edit process, it comes down to four minutes.\nHow many beats did y'all throw away today, sir?\nSir, how many bars did y'all cut from this album today?\nFour. How many fucking bars?\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, calm down, motherfucker.\nMy name's K Dot, remember?\nKendrick Mother Fucking Lamer.\nAlright, alright, alright.\nLet's take a breath, brother.\nTake a deep breath.\nHey, yo, I'm sorry about earlier.\nI'm sorry about earlier, man.\nIt wasn't personal.\nYo, man, I'm trying to find myself.\nI'm trying to stay true to art form.\nI ain't making no commercial hits.\nI'm not putting no platinum plaques on the fridge.\nI'm making real hip hop, baby boy.\nReal street, real authentic, real honest-to-God hip hop.\nI'm pouring my heart and soul onto wax.\nCuz that's the way hip hop works, man.\nIt's real simple stuff.\nOne minute you're hot, next minute you're not.\nNext minute you're dead.\nLook at Tupac Shakur, man.\nTupac died 20 years ago, yet we still celebrate him every year.\nWhy?\nWhy do we still pay tribute to Biggie Smalls?\nFor Christ's sake, we called him Biggie Smalls.\nBiggie smalldicks.\nWow.\nHe was huge.\nThat's why they called him Biggie Smalldick.\nB-I-double-gie-smalldick-alright.\nHis dick was small.\nLadies, gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Mr. Jay-Z.\nHello, New York City. This is DJ Kool Herc.\nEverybody knows who I am already, but I might as well introduce myself.\nDJ Kool Herc, founder of modern-day hip-hop music itself.\nNobody knew about hip-hop till I invented turntable scratching and locking the beat.\nRight here in the South Bronx, Queensbridge Project, New York City.\nAin't nobody touching this.\nLocking the beat means that I took both platters, turned the volume down, and kept rocking nonstop.\nRocking forever till the wheels fall off.\nHoo-ah, hoo-ha, hoohahaha, hoo-ho-ho-ha-ha.\nWhooo-whooo-whoooo-oopity-doo-waa-waaa-wawawa-pat-a-cake-mama-papa-pop-like-an-instrument-you-can't-touch-this-hey-yo-my-name-is-jay-z-and-i'm-from-the-bronx-where-kids-play-with-xenon-lights-but-it-sounds-good-on-beats-by-the-pound-so-listen-up-as-we-get-started-talking-about-shit-that-happens-around-town-right-now.\nNigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga-nigga, nigga-nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga,"
