"Script:\n\nHey, you know what's wild? When you're on vacation, excited to explore new places... but first, you gotta play 'find my suitcase'. (pauses for laughter) I mean, it's like that game where you have to find yourself after college.\n\nI was at the airport once; my bag didn't show up until two days later – with a note saying they'd given me someone else's clothes by mistake! It had a wedding dress inside. Now I'm thinking about this person who wore last night's party outfit on their honeymoon day. That's some real-life rom-com stuff right there!\n\nAnd then there's when airlines tell us our bags will be delivered within an hour. You wait three hours, start checking social media... meanwhile, mine is probably chillin' somewhere, getting free massages from airport staff. They've got priority parking, food vouchers... and we get nothing except \"it'll arrive soon\" – which means never. \n\nWe need an app just for tracking missing suitcases. Like Uber or Lyft, but instead of cars, it shows all these random people walking around airports carrying other peoples' bags. Title would be 'LugHub': 'Where did my shirt go?' 'Hmm, let me check LugHub.'"
