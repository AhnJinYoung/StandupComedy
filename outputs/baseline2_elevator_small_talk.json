"(Setup): \"I don't like it when people ask me where I'm from.\"\n(Incongruity): \"It's not that they always get it wrong\"\n(Punchline): \"it is but i just think there's an assumption behind the question right if someone asks you where your from oh man i can tell by your accent well this guy looks like he was born yesterday so let's see what happens here\"\n(Callback): \"there's kind of a hierarchy to these questions too yeah uh huh right\"\n(Settup): \"If someone asks you where you're from first off why do you care?\"\n(Incongruity): \"But then depending on how old you look compared to the person asking the question it could be either really flattering or really embarrassing, right? Yeah.\"\n(Punchline): \"For example, if somebody younger than me asked me where I am from, I'd probably feel good about myself, because at least my face doesn't give away any information, right? Like, if I walk into a room with some young hipster who's wearing glasses, skinny jeans, Converse shoes, and a scarf around his neck, and he goes, hey dude, where are you from? And I go, I'm from Canada, bro, he'll know exactly what I mean.\"\n(Callback): \"Like, we've got mountains, hockey rinks, moose, polar bears... You wouldn't even need more than one word!\"\n(Setup): \"And I would take pride knowing that I pulled the wool over his eyes, you know?\"\n(Incongruity): \"He thought he had me cornered with those fancy pants and the hairnet, didn't he? Didn't work, did it? No way! Gotcha! Haha ha ha ha ha! Yeah, nice try, kid.\"\n(Punchline): \"Now, on the other hand, if someone older than me were to ask me where I'm from, you know, say like a grandma or something, that's different story altogether, all right?\"\n(Callback): \"Then I might start getting a little defensive, maybe even lie to her, which isn't very Canadian of me at all, actually.\"\n(Setup): \"That's usually our biggest mistake as Canadians down south, is lying about being American, because apparently nobody believes us.\"\n(Incongruity): \"They never buy it. They're always like, no, buddy, come out now, you liar.\"\n(Punchline): \"So, instead, I started doing this thing called the Canadian Accent Switcheroo.\"\n(Callback): \"Yeah, basically, whenever anyone under the age of 40 asks me where I'm from, I switch accents. From a moment's notice. It's amazing.\"\n(Setup): \"From Canuck to Cockney in two seconds flat, baby.\"\n(Incongruity): \"No problem. Not easy, though.\"\n(Punchline): \"Not everyone has it in them. All right? So if you want to master this technique yourself, here's what you gotta do.\"\n(Callback): \"First, you gotta relax your tongue, put your mouth together like a fish.\"\n(Setup): \"Secondly, tighten up your vocal cords.\"\n(Incongruity): \"Third, pretend you're trying to pull the tag off a t-shirt.\"\n(Punchline): \"Fourth, make sure your nose hairs aren't touching your upper lip anymore.\"\n(Callback): \"And fifth, remember to breathe.\"\n(Setup): \"All right? That last part is crucial.\""
