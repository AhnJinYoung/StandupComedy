Like if someone's taking me somewhere, they're like oh it doesn't matter let's go have an ice cream or something and then we get there and some guy just failed his driver's license so now he can never leave this place again which seems pretty cool to me that's great i would date him right okay but no he'll be like yeah man i should tell her about how i passed the first time round she'd love hearing all about that and i'd be like mate don't bother because honestly nothing else really matters after seeing somebody drive into traffic does it? Like... It was amazing! Did anyone see that? That little red car went straight over there! Oh my god! So close though wasn't it? Yeah! Passed with flying colours actually!",
