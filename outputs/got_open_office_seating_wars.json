But even those haters would argue, all right? Even us haters would say that if we were going to try something new like open offices again, here's how we'd fix it. We'd make sure everyone had their own private space or cubicle or whatever you want to call it, but just give them their own room so no one can bother you. And if you didn't know someone else is bothering you based solely off of sound alone, come up with a noise-cancelling headset for free. That's not too much to ask. You could charge $50 bucks for it. It wouldn't be weird. If anything, the person wearing headphones in public should get paid extra money as well. They shouldn't only listen to music while walking around outside either.",

Not only does it suck for me personally, driving around LA getting honked at, almost hitting pedestrians, and losing my mind every single day. But it really hurts the economy as well, according to studies done recently. Because if you spend more than two hours stuck in traffic per week, chances are good that you won't feel motivated to buy stuff later in the evening when you finally arrive at your destination.

Never once heard a male feminist say that. Only females talking about feminism. Men rarely discuss gender equality amongst themselves, unfortunately.
