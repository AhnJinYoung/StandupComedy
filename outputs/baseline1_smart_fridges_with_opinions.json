"I'm happy to be doing this for you, man.\nIt's very exciting.\nA lot of people don't know that I have Tourette's syndrome because it looks like every other white guy who ever had an opinion about anything.\nBut yeah, if there was any doubt based on my body language or speech patterns, let me just clarify right now by saying I do indeed suffer from Tourette's syndrome, which is great because I love being different, but not everyone does.\nSo when someone asks how many of us out there live with Tourettessyndrome I always want them to give more specific answers so we can all feel included even though they're asking the question\nbut honestly speaking i think it would probably be easier if we were talking to each other face-to-face instead of over some computer screen wouldn't you agree sir?\nBecause then I could see what kind of day you've been having before answering whether I think you should worry about getting shot down again.\nThat's why I wish that Facebook Live existed back at the time when I first got diagnosed with Tourettes.\nAnd unfortunately, things didn't turn out well for me, did they? Didn't work out real well.\nMy parents put up posters around town. We went door-to-door trying to find a kid that fit the description.\nTurns out he wasn't found until much later in life when somebody started making really good videos online called Jeffree Star.\nOh! Oh, that joke doesn't quite land yet.\nGive me another minute, okay? All right.\nWe also tried therapy, which... Which made things worse.\nThe therapist actually told me to relax while I tattled on him!\nYeah. Yeah, thank you guys for laughing.\nSorry about that. Sorry.\nAll right. No, seriously.\nThings aren't funny anymore. It's too hard to get stuff done.\nLike, we need to talk about our phones.\nThis is going to sound crazy, especially since no one has seen me in person lately, but...\nI am addicted to my phone. Like, I cannot stop using my phone.\nI use FaceTime to order food, check myself into a mental hospital, send nudes, text my family members during meetings, Facetime to watch TV shows, play Fortnite, read books, make playlists, listen to podcasts, browse Twitter, watch TikTok videos, scroll through Instagram stories, shop online, play Tetris, call my grandma, check the weather, look up recipes, take pictures of the clouds, play Snake Classic, Facetune selfies, write articles, check email, record standup specials, edit movies, film music videos, Facetime friends during sex.\nWait, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on. What'd y'all say?\nWhat'd y'all say? Did you hear that? Wow. That felt amazing.\nThank you so much. Thank you so much.\nNo, seriously. Stop clapping. You shouldn't be cheering.\nWhat happened earlier tonight, that wasn't normal behavior. And nobody likes a weirdo, alright?\nNobody likes a freak, alright? Nobody likes an outsider. Nobody likes an oddball. Nobody likes an anomaly. Nobody likes an irregularity.\nJust throw away your phone. Go outside. Play catch. Take a nap.\nIf you saw me today after show and gave me a thumbs up, please keep giving me those. Those mean nothing to me either way, okay?\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go update these jokes on my phone.\nAnyway, enough about technology. Let's move on to something else. How about appliances? Anybody familiar with Amazon Alexa?\nAnybody heard of her? She's cool. Very popular among ladies.\nShe helps you lose weight and gives solid dating advice.\nWhen she wants to hook up with you, she whispers sweet nothings directly into your earpiece.\nWhenever you try to hit her, she responds by reminding you that you're fat.\nHas anybody met a lady named Echo? Is anyone familiar with Google Home Mini?\nDoesn't matter if you don't understand the reference. Just remember, you're wrong.\nAlso, welcome to hell.\nGoogle Assistant is a little bit creepier than Alexa, isn't she?\nNot sure why you laughed at that one. Not everybody loves Google Assistant.\nSome people hate Google Assistant. Some people can't stand her.\nOne person wrote, oh, she sounds creepy and passive-aggressive.\nAnother one said, she seems condescending.\nAnd then last year, a few users chimed in writing, Google Assistant is sexist.\nWhich I thought was interesting given that I used to date a girl who wanted to become a female impersonator for years.\nNever took off, but she kept working at it anyway.\nEventually became a regional manager for Chick-fil-A.\nThanks for listening to me talk about technology and home assistants.\nBefore I leave, I want to ask you guys two questions.\nNumber one, have you guys ever noticed that smartphones have gotten ridiculously expensive?\nLast year alone, Samsung released three new flagships within months of each other ranging from $700 to $1,800.\nMeanwhile, Apple released their own pair of iPhones priced at $600 and $1,500 respectively.\nAs if one iPhone per month weren't enough, both companies followed suit releasing additional models costing between $900 to $2,000 apiece.\nThey added cameras. They removed buttons. They moved ports. They changed designs. And still, you guys bought every single goddamn model.\nHow stupid are you?! Why did you buy four separate devices that do exactly the same thing?\nDo you think you might be gay?\nAre you high right now? Are you under the influence? Do you have a problem?\nThere must be something wrong with you.\nDid you think maybe next quarter there will be a better camera setup?\nOr perhaps you believed future-proofing would save money long-term.\nMaybe you thought buying multiple handsets simultaneously would secure yourself a spot amongst the tech elite.\nWhatever your reasoning may be, rest assured you made a huge mistake.\nIn fact, I challenge each and every one of you to name five occasions where owning four identical cellphones proved beneficial.\nOkay. Okay. Three. Two. One.\nZero. Zero? Zero! You zero-ed the fuck out.\nWell, guess what, suckers? The worst part is only half the country owns smartphones nowadays.\nHalf the world lives without access to internet and Wi-Fi.\nThey survive fine. Maybe we should learn from their examples, huh?\nSecondly, most of you have never heard of Smart Fridges.\nAnybody unfamiliar with Smart Fridge? Anyone heard of a fridge that talks to its owner?\nTalks to its owner? Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, yes ma'am, yes ma'am, yes ma'am.\nHere's how it works, folks. When you open the refrigerator door, the fridge says hello.\nThen, depending on what type of milk you purchased, it tells you a knock-knock joke.\nOn occasion, the kitchen appliance goes ahead and offers helpful suggestions, such as recommending a recipe or suggesting the best brand of cheese for pizza night.\nSmart Fridge is pretty clever, except sometimes it gets a little carried away with the flirting.\nFor example, if you eat a meal prepared inside the oven located adjacent to the refrigerator, it starts calling you daddy.\nDaddy, come taste my buns. Daddy, help me clean the stove.\nCome and sit on my lap. Come sit on my counter.\nYes, papa. Papa, feed me dinner. Feed me meatballs.\nOoh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,"
