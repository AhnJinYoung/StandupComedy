If you're white and I don't know that you're white, but based on how long it's taken me to figure out what kind of pants you have on, by the time we finish shopping together, if there is a shooting in America, I am blaming y'all. That's my policy. You understand? Okay? My friend Rachel told me she was at her local grocery store with her little boy who has autism, they were doing their weekly shop, when another woman came up to them and started screaming at her child. She said, hey lady, stop hitting your kid! And then my friend Rachel explained that he wasn't actually hitting himself. He had just learned to make noises like he was getting hit so people would help him open his own bags at checkout using our hands instead of those stupid bag machines because some of us are better than other things. And the woman went off on her about being an ableist bitch.",
