"(Setup): \"I went to Walmart recently.\"\n(Incongruity): \"Not my favorite place.\"\n(Punchline): \"Because I hate going through those automatic doors at Walmart that open up when you walk towards them because they know your fat ass is coming by themselves\"\n(Callback): \"and then just as quickly slam shut behind me like, oh no! She's lost!\"\n(Setup): \"And she was right.\"\n(Punchline): \"It took me forever to get back there.\"\n(Setup): \"So it turned into one of these days where... Like, I didn't even care about shopping anymore.\"\n(Incongruity): \"I'm just trying to find the self-checkout lanes so I can be alone with myself again.\"\n(Punchline): \"Like, you need some time away from people?\"\n(Callback): \"Just go check out yourself. Right here.\"\n(Setup): \"But before we do this, let me tell y'all something real quick.\"\n(Incongruity): \"If you don't shoplift now, what's wrong with you? You're wasting your time.\"\n(Punchline): \"No seriously though, if you don't steal stuff from stores, you might want to think about getting better stuff.\"\n(Callback): \"That's all I'm saying.\"\n(Setup): \"Anyway, I finally found one of those machines.\"\n(Punchline): \"Thank God. It's quiet, peaceful, nice break from everybody else.\"\n(Callback): \"Now I could relax.\"\n(Setup): \"This guy comes over next to me.\"\n(Incongruity): \"He starts scanning his groceries.\"\n(Punchline): \"Looked down at him, he had on socks and sandals.\"\n(Callback): \"All right, buddy, you're not doing too good today either, huh?\"\n(Setup): \"We both stink.\"\n(Punchline): \"Yeah, I've been wearing those Crocs since April.\"\n(Callback): \"Thanks for asking.\"\n(Setup): \"Oh yeah, it got warm once, but...\"\n(Punchline): \"...it ain't hot enough yet for flip-flops.\"\n(Callback): \"Okay? Get off my nuts.\"\n(Setup): \"Stop laughing, yes ma'am, you sound ignorant.\"\n(Punchline): \"Your turn, sir.\"\n(Callback): \"Let's hear it.\"\n(Setup): \"There's only two kinds of footwear acceptable during summertime, okay?\"\n(Incongruity): \"Sandals, which means toes exposed, not socks and shoes.\"\n(Punchline): \"Or boots, cowboy boots or hiking boots, anything with laces long enough to keep sand out.\"\n(Callback): \"Anything less than three inches above the ankle bone is sandals, baby girl.\"\n(Setup): \"Don't try to come up under me with that.\"\n(Punchline): \"Hey, excuse me, sir.\"\n(Callback): \"What'd I say? You want to talk about ignorance?\""
