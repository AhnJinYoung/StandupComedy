"Script:\n\n\"Hey, you know what's wild? Airports that have more outlets than my grandma has grandkids. I mean, it's like they're trying to make up for all those overpriced coffee shops by giving us free power.\n\n\"I was at LAX last week, and I swear every other chair had an outlet built into it. It's like they knew we'd be so desperate for juice that we'd start charging our phones while sitting on them. 'Sorry about the delay, folks – just give me another minute to charge this thing.'\n\n\"And don't even get me started on the ones that say 'Power available' next to each seat. Like, who comes across one of these signs and thinks, 'Oh great, now I can finally top off my phone... after paying $12 for a bagel?'\n\n\"But seriously though, if air travel became a competition based solely on how many outlets per square foot, some airport would win hands down. And then we could put 'Outlet champion of the world' right above their logo.\""
