"Script:\n\n\"You know what's wild about dating apps? They're like online grocery shopping, but instead of just buying milk, you're hoping to buy love or at least someone who won't ghost you after one date.\n\nI was swiping through Tinder recently, and I saw this guy with a profile picture that said 'Climbing enthusiast.' Which is code for, 'I'm either going to die on a mountain or get into an argument over who left the dishes dirty.'\n\nAnd then there were these guys claiming they can cook up a storm – literally, because their pictures showed them wearing chef hats while standing next to ovens. Like, dude, we don't care if you make a mean spaghetti Bolognese; do you have any actual substance?\n\nBut my favorite part is when people put up profiles saying things like, 'Witty banter expert' or 'Adventure-seeker extraordinaire!' Meanwhile, our conversation consists solely of me asking how old they are and whether they still live with mom... and dad.\""
