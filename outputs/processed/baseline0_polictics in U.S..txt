Hey, you know what's wild about politics? We're like that one couple who can't agree on anything – except for the fact we both hate each other. (pause) That's basically Congress.  I love how politicians say'my fellow Americans' before saying something ridiculous. Like, no, dude, I'm not your fellow American until you tell me my healthcare is free. Then maybe we'll be buddies!  And have you noticed how every politician claims to want change but still wears a suit from last century? It's like they're trying to make us believe, This guy has been around since Reagan! He must be honest!  We complain about our government being divided, yet we put them all together in Washington D.C., expecting some kind of miracle. Newsflash it's called compromise, folks. But don't worry; if you're an extremist, there are plenty of jobs available... at Fox or CNN. Pick your poison!  But seriously though, have you seen those town hall meetings where everyone gets loud? Sounds exactly like family gatherings during holidays. Same principle applies – just louder, with more anger. And less turkey.
