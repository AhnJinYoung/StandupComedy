I just hate it when I'm doing something normal like going to the toilet or taking out my contact lenses, right? And then suddenly you hear that unmistakable sound of an iPhone camera shutter clicking away in real life. And you think to yourself... what? What is happening?! Why do we live on this planet?! It's nuts! Right? We're losing our minds over there. No one knows why they're alive anymore.
Oh man, I was walking down the street recently, and some kid snapped a photo with his phone, and he went running after me to hand it back because apparently it caught him looking weird by accident. So now I know how Princess Diana felt all those years ago.
Now every time I see someone with their finger hovering over the screen as if waiting for something magical to happen, I feel myself being pulled into that vortex too.
I'm like, oh my God, there's magic out there! Then I get sucked down the rabbit hole of an endless browser tab.
So I find myself scrolling through Instagram until I've scrolled so far I end up staring at some stranger's profile picture wondering where did I go wrong?
 Yeah, but people don't realise, you can be anywhere in your house, right? You could be having sex, you could have got ready for work.
 But here comes Binx, mate. He'll creep into your bedroom while you're getting naked. While you're putting on your socks. In the bathroom, while you're washing your face.
 And then he snaps a quick shot of you with your mouth hanging open and your balls swinging free.
 Now listen guys I love technology I genuinely believe that tech has improved our lives massively okay let's not argue about that.
 The problem though is social media hasn't made us happier has it fellas no way right?
 What happened is we've lost control of who gets access to photos of us.
