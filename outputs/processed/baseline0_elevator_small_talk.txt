You know what's wild about elevators? It's like we're all trapped together, but nobody wants to actually talk to each other – until someone presses the wrong floor button.  Hi, how's it going? Oh great. We don't even need to say that anymore; just nodding is fine. Like we're at some kind of awkward silent dance competition.  And then there's the person who says, 'We're almost there!' while standing on my side, completely blocking me from moving. I'm not sure if they think I have teleportation powers or something.  But you know what's funnier still? When people try to break the ice with their kid. Look, honey! A new friend! No, buddy, this guy's been stuck in this metal box for three minutes too; he doesn't want to be friends either. Just let him enjoy his personal space... which is roughly two square feet right now. (pause) That's why I love elevator conversations so much. They're basically free therapy sessions where everyone gets annoyed by themselves afterwards.
