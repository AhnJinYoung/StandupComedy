The top door opens up into the fridge itself and then there's another bottom drawer that comes out separately from the fridge just for all the frozen stuff.
Setup So if you want ice cream or something, you can open the freezer compartment without opening up the rest of the refrigerator.
Because sometimes when I'm like eating cereal or something in the morning, my stomach'll get too full really quick because they're so big.
So what happens is, as soon as I finish breakfast, right away I feel bloated to start off with.
 Then about an hour later, I think maybe I need to go take a nap.
 I don't know why I do this either because I always have work to be doing during the day.
 It could also happen where I might eat lunch early before I leave work.
 And by the time I come home around dinner time again, I feel tired already.
 And then after dinner, I've got nothing left to do but watch TV until bedtime.
 My housemates, we live together. They moved here recently. So everything was new for them.
 They didn't even notice how much space there was between us.
 They thought our place had been newly renovated.
 All they did was put some fresh paint on the walls and install double-glazed windows.
(Crowd laughs)
 But no one noticed anything else.
