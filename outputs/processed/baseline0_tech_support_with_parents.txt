Hey, you know who's really good at their jobs? Tech support people... for my parents' generation! (pauses) I mean, they're like superheroes of troubleshooting.  So, Mom calls me saying she can't figure out her computer. And I'm on the phone trying to guide her through it – Click'start', no wait, click 'exit'. Oh, don't press anything yet! It's like we're playing this crazy game of 'tech-support telephone'.  Meanwhile, Dad is watching over us thinking he knows more than both of us combined. He starts yelling into the phone, What do you want from me?! You think I just sit around all day clicking buttons? Um, yeah, that sounds about right.  I swear, if there was an Olympic sport for holding one's breath while listening to someone explain how to use Windows Explorer, my family would take home gold medals every time. They make it sound so complicated!  But honestly though, after years of dealing with them, I've realized something profound If technology were easier to understand, we'd be living in a world where elderly folks say things like, Oh, great, another Zoom meeting. Not Why does this contraption have a button labeled 'Wi-Fi' but still won't connect?  That's progress, folks. That's innovation. Now let's get back to figuring out how to use Google Maps... again.
