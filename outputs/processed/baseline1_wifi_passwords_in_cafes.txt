One thing that I do quite often when I'm on my laptop is go to a cafe, right? Now, if you've ever been into one of these places before, it's like walking through an airport security checkpoint, isn't it? Because they're always asking for information. They don't care about what you want to buy from them anymore. They just really care who you're going to tell. I have got no idea why we still call them Wi-Fi because every time you connect now to public networks, there's some kind of warning message coming up saying things like, this network may be unsecured or not secure at all. And yet whenever I get to any place where they've put out their own special little box with their WiFi password written on it next to it, I think to myself, surely that's even less secure than anything else i could pick off the internet. That can only belong to that particular company, so they must know exactly how many people will use it by the end of today. So therefore, you should assume everybody knows already. But what I usually find is I'll try and read whatever password they've come up with. It might say something like 'WELCOME TO THE COFFEE SHOP'. My initial thought then would probably be well done guys very original I didn't see that coming but unfortunately most times I also look around me and realise nobody has bothered reading theirs either. What they tend to do instead is take the first letter off each word and join those letters together. So they'd end up with W-T-C-S, which sounds pretty safe to me. The problem is though sometimes there's more words involved in there than four, right? Like, let's imagine our coffee shop here had decided to write their password as follows welcome to the best independent coffee shop in town. If someone were to take the first letter off each individual word in there, they'd end up with w-t-b-i-c-s-i-t. Thank you. Thank you so much!
