I went to Walmart recently.  Not my favorite place.  Because I hate going through those automatic doors at Walmart that open up when you walk towards them because they know your fat ass is coming by themselves  and then just as quickly slam shut behind me like, oh no! She's lost!  And she was right.  It took me forever to get back there.  So it turned into one of these days where... Like, I didn't even care about shopping anymore.  I'm just trying to find the self-checkout lanes so I can be alone with myself again.  Like, you need some time away from people?  Just go check out yourself. Right here.  But before we do this, let me tell y'all something real quick.  If you don't shoplift now, what's wrong with you? You're wasting your time.  No seriously though, if you don't steal stuff from stores, you might want to think about getting better stuff.  That's all I'm saying.  Anyway, I finally found one of those machines.  Thank God. It's quiet, peaceful, nice break from everybody else.  Now I could relax.  This guy comes over next to me.  He starts scanning his groceries.  Looked down at him, he had on socks and sandals.  All right, buddy, you're not doing too good today either, huh?  We both stink.  Yeah, I've been wearing those Crocs since April.  Thanks for asking.  Oh yeah, it got warm once, but...  ...it ain't hot enough yet for flip-flops.  Okay? Get off my nuts.  Stop laughing, yes ma'am, you sound ignorant.  Your turn, sir.  Let's hear it.  There's only two kinds of footwear acceptable during summertime, okay?  Sandals, which means toes exposed, not socks and shoes.  Or boots, cowboy boots or hiking boots, anything with laces long enough to keep sand out.  Anything less than three inches above the ankle bone is sandals, baby girl.  Don't try to come up under me with that.  Hey, excuse me, sir.  What'd I say? You want to talk about ignorance?
