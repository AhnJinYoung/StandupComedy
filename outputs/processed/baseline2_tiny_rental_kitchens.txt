A couple years ago I moved into my first apartment.  It's one of those apartments where they call it an efficiency apartment because there is no kitchen.  That's what they called them when people were really efficient at cooking but now it just means you're shit out of luck.  I was like, oh this is cool! It'll be fun to cook together!  And then we got in there and it was so small that whenever he tried to stir something with his hand, he would hit me in the face.  So yeah, let's not do that anymore, shall we?  We don't even need to date again, okay? We've already done enough harm  This place has been around since 1892 which honestly feels about right if you think about it considering how long it took us to get married  My husband loves our little microkitchen though He thinks it's charming And I'm happy for him So am I But I miss having food options beyond toast  There's only two appliances in here A toaster oven and a microwave You know when a building says it has a toaster oven that doesn't mean anything It could just be some weird dude named Toby Owen living down there doing whatever Toby Owens do  He can make all kinds of things in here too Like pizza casserole  Like I said we both work full time so we don't eat together much Which is fine.  But sometimes I feel bad for him Because he eats alone all day every day by himself while working from home as well  The same four walls That guy needs to break free man Break free Get outside Go see other humans Make new friends Play fetch with strangers Just go get yourself a dog god damn  If your girlfriend won't take you anywhere why not bring your own companion everywhere that way everybody wins
