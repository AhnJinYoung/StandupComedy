You know what's wild about these new smart fridges? They're like therapists, but instead of giving you advice, they just tell you how bad you are at grocery shopping. Reminder expired yogurt. Like I didn't notice it was moldy already.  And have you seen those'fridge analytics'? It's basically my entire relationship with food summed up – 75% leftovers from takeout that will never get eaten, 20% wilting vegetables because I forgot to water them... (laughs)  But honestly, who needs self-help when your fridge is just gonna be all like, You ate pizza for dinner three times this week or Why do you still have last year's Christmas cookies? That thing's got more judgment than my aunt at Thanksgiving. (chuckles)
