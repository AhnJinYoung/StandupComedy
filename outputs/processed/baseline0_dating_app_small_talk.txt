You know what's wild about online dating? We're all just sitting there, swiping through profiles like we're shopping for shoes – 'Oh, I'll take this one with the good hair.' But then you start talking to someone, and it's like trying to have a conversation with Siri on mute.  I was chatting with some guy, and he said, What do you like doing on a Saturday? And I'm thinking, 'Dude, that's not even a real question anymore!' It used to be, but now people say stuff like, Do you travel often? No, dude, unless by traveling, you mean walking from my couch to the fridge.  And don't get me started on questions starting with If. Like, if you really want to know something, why not ask directly instead of giving me an existential crisis? If you could go anywhere... Oh no, please tell me I can go somewhere where I won't die alone!  But honestly, sometimes these conversations feel more like hostage negotiations than dates. The other day, someone asked me, Are you looking for anything serious? And I thought, 'Wow, finally someone who wants to marry me... after five minutes of messaging each other.'  It's funny; when did our lives become so transactional? Can anyone else see themselves in a Craigslist ad at this point?  Anyway, if any single men or women out there are watching, let me give you some advice next time you swipe right, put down your phone before asking the life-altering questions. Trust me, it makes things way less awkward. Or should I say, less deadly? (laughs)
