You know what's wild about renting? The kitchen is basically just an afterthought, like 'oh yeah, we'll throw some cabinets over there.' (pauses) I mean, have you seen those tiny rentals lately? It's like they're trying to see how many people can fit inside with their arms crossed.  And then you try to cook something – pasta sauce, eggs, maybe toast... but nope! You've got to do it on that postage-stamp-sized counter while balancing on one foot because of course the other side has a giant sink taking up all the space.  I'm pretty sure the landlord thinks if we can't even get this small cooking thing right, we deserve ramen noodles for life. And honestly, at this point, I think I'd be more productive buying instant soup than fighting my way through those microscopic appliances.
