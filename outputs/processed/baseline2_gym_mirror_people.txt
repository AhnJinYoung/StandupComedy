I'm gonna be honest with you guys, I hate going to the gym.  The only thing that keeps me coming back is seeing other dudes do it.  Like if there's one dude at the gym who makes all his sets look like they're done by accident, then I know he works out every day.  He doesn't need any motivation because he loves doing this shit so much.  And what gets my heart rate up more than anything else?  When some guy starts looking himself up in the mirror while he's working out.  That's when things get interesting.  No matter how simple their exercise looks, just watch them check themselves out after every single rep.  What the fuck? You don't even want your bicep curl to end yet!  But here we go! Oh no, did I lift correctly?  Oh man, oh man. The whole time i thought i was lifting but now i feel like i've been lowering  i should have known cause i didn't hear anybody say lower right before i started  that'd probably be somebody named steve though wouldn't it always steve  steve would come over everybody start getting into formation  and then once everyone's set let him count down together  three two one zero okay now you got to keep those arms straight until you hear me go again  you can see yourself doing it too  but nobody likes you, Steve.
