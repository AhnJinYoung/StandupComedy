Set up I don't know if you guys have seen this, but there's all these new artificial intelligence tools coming out where they're like making apologies on behalf of other companies or individuals?
Each component must be in this format {SENTENCE NUMBER (SENTENCE).
 Oh my god, I saw one recently from Uber about an employee who was caught spying on users with their app! You can imagine how weird that would feel to see Uber just write me a letter saying we had no idea what our guy was doing. It was not us. We did nothing wrong here. Our employees were acting independently. That is completely... How dare you?
I've been feeling very paranoid ever since because now whenever I get into any ride share vehicle, especially if the driver has a black car, I'm always looking for cameras. Like maybe he doesn't work for Uber anymore, right? He could still be working for them. They could send him after me. Can't rule anything out. Not even a little bit. Not yet.
I don't know about you guys but my paranoia reached an all-time high when I realized we're being tracked by Amazon.
I got to start wearing my life jacket everywhere.
I think it's going to take some time before I feel comfortable again with all of these ride shares. But you know what they say about time healing all wounds.
And then it gets worse when you think about it because like with Lyft, they have those yellow cars. So what's to stop Lyft from hiring someone who used to drive for Uber and giving them one of these yellow cars?
 Because now they'd look identical except instead of Uber written across the side, it'll just have L-I-F-T spelled backwards.

Then there's no one to answer if you press panic on the lift.
I think what's happening is people are getting used to seeing cars with their names on them driving around.
And then you get on one and there's no driver.
