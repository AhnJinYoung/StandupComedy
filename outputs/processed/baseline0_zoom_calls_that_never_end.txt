You know what's wild about Zoom? The meetings that have no agenda, but somehow they're still going on for an hour. It's like my grandma's gossip sessions – 'I'm just calling to say hello.' But it turns out you've been talking for three hours.  Or how about when someone says, 'We'll be right with you,' and then I spend the next five minutes watching them scroll through their emails while we wait?  And don't even get me started on virtual happy hours that start at 5 PM and turn into 10 PM. Who knew having drinks together over video could lead to so much small talk?  (Pause)  I swear, some people think Zoom is code for 'we need to catch up' or something. Newsflash if we really needed to catch up, we'd schedule a face-to-face meeting... or send each other actual letters.  (Applause)
