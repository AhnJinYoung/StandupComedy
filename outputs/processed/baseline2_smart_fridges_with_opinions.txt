I love how all these new kitchen appliances we're getting now come out as if they can think.  Like my fridge's called Family Hub.  And that is not true because it does not fucking know where I live!  It has never phoned me to say, hey, John, why don't you pop down?  Your mum rang us. We've got some stuff she wanted to show you.  We can do that, right? Just go up to your local Samsung outlet and ask them about their family hub fridge freezers.  Just walk into any showroom like this... Hi there! What's going on? Oh no! You guys still using paper notes?! Are you insane?!
