I've been traveling so much lately.  And I'm very excited about this travel thing because it's nice to see that there are still places left where you can go like an asshole.  That is my favorite part. The fact that you could be rude as shit at certain places around the world.  Like, I was recently on a train from New York City into Boston.  Now, if you don't know what we're talking about here, just imagine being trapped inside a subway car during rush hour when one person decides they want to fart right after eating Indian food.  Just imagine that.  So I'm sitting down minding my own business reading the paper  this lady gets up off her seat she walks over towards me i didn't realize i took all those steps now she tapped me on the shoulder she said excuse me may i use your phone?  My name is Joe Henry. My job is not sharing phones!  She did apologize profusely afterwards but...  The only other place besides India... That would make sense.  Because obviously Indians live there.  But no! This airport has more power sockets than the entire country of India combined!  Yeah, I think I'll take their wall outlet situation any day, thank you very much!
