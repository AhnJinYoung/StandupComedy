I'm on my phone, trying to get online so that I can check what time it is or send an email back home because I'll be away from Wi-Fi for like two weeks, but you know how it goes.
Setup So there's always this moment where you're sitting down with all of your belongings around you and then someone walks by and they say something like 'Hey buddy do you have the password for the Wi-Fi?'
Setup And immediately without thinking about it i just go oh no absolutely i don't want you to use my internet
I feel like if we had free healthcare, our politicians would actually care.
Because right now politicians only really give a shit when people vote them out office which means their entire campaign was based on lies.
 But here's the thing, here's why I think Bernie Sanders might win.
 Here's why I think Bernie Sanders might win, he doesn't talk like other politicians.
 He talks like regular people speak to each other.
 Like when he came out during his last election saying things like Medicare For All, Free College Tuition.
 A lot of young white women were like, I hate Bernie! He wants to make college free!
 I was like, yeah, and that way you wouldn't owe $100,000 dollars after graduation.
 If Bernie gets elected, I'm going to vote again.
The reason I haven't voted before is because I've been living outside of America for over six years.
 It turns out you need to live inside of America to be able to vote.
