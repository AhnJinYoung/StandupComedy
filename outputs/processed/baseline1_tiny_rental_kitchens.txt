I was going to tell you about my relationship, but I'm not really ready for that yet. That's fine! My boyfriend is very nice! Thank you so much! That means nothing coming from you because this guy would be on TV if he weren't already doing it. He's amazing, though. We're having fun together. One of our favorite things to do when we hang out is watch me cook. It sounds crazy, but there's something sexy about watching me make ramen noodles or whatever. And honestly, sexier than anything else I can offer him at home. Because his old place had like a full kitchen with all four walls intact. So now whenever he comes over to my apartment where everything has been ripped out behind me... ...he gets treated to an incredible cooking experience every single time. Every step of making food back here feels exactly like what I imagine being raped by someone who doesn't know how to use power tools must feel like. But they'll laugh later. There's always some weird little bonus thing that happens along the way. Like last week, while I was boiling water, I accidentally knocked off one of my glasses from the shelf, which shattered into hundreds of pieces everywhere around me. But then after I cleaned up most of them, another glass fell down from nowhere, just hit the ground perfectly, and exploded into thousands more pieces right next to me. Which made the mess even worse. But also kind of impressed, you know? When I turned around, I said to myself, oh shit, did I throw one? How many have I thrown? Why didn't any get stuck to me? This isn't happening. This isn't real life. There's no way. Then I looked outside through the window and saw two cats staring at me like I'm a fucking magician or something. They were both just looking at me thinking like wow she could fly too i don't think anyone should eat tonight actually thank you guys so much take care bye
