I've got this friend of mine, she's always like, oh my god guys I'm doing intermittent fasting right now you know what that means it means I only eat between midnight to noon and then I fast for all day tomorrow but it's not called fasting it's just called dieting because we're cunts that is correct call us out on our bullshit okay if someone was like yo fam i'm trying to lose weight you'd be like well why don't you stop eating? You can do anything, mate! That's so weird being an adult isn't it? Because when you were younger, you never thought about how much money things would cost or anything like that. But as soon as you become aware that there's money involved in everything, it kind of ruins everything forever. Like, growing up, we used to love getting McDonald's at lunch time after school. And every single kid wanted one with eight nuggets and large fries and milkshake and they'd want two straws and share them together no matter where they came from in life you could be gay black chinese white everyone was cool united until something changed along the way some point maybe around their early twenties maybe late teens people started becoming snobs over stuff yeah like i think the main culprit behind that is tinder actually man because uh dating apps have made everybody super picky over certain foods yeah especially fruit really yeah even worse than meat you'll find yourself swiping through these profiles you might come across somebody they say they like pineapple on pizza and you're straight away like nah thank you alright get the f*** out of here. Yeah, I mean, fair play, though, dude. If anyone ever tried to put pineapple on my pizza, I'd definitely end their life. It makes sense, doesn't it? Like, we hate pineapples on pizzas, but we love ham hocks on pizzas. What's going on with those toppings, bruv? Alright, see you later! God bless you! See you later! Bye-bye! But also, imagine having sex with somebody, and halfway through, they go, oopsie-daisy, by the way, I forgot to tell you I ate Chinese last night. Oh my gosh, sorry, babe. Yeah, I had stir-fry and rice. No, I didn't use chopsticks. It hurt my wrist too much. Do you want me to start again? Sorry, darling. Oh, um... Is that a bit cold down there? Okay, bye. No, listen, I'm vegan, but he thinks I ate chicken. If you're looking for new recipes online, check out vegan websites, and look into plant-based diets. When I first moved into my flat, I shared it with three other housemates, and none of them knew how to cook. And I said to myself, you know what, Mike? This will be a great opportunity to teach others how to cook and gain more friends, right? So, the next morning, I sent a WhatsApp group message saying, hey guys, let's make pancakes today. Who wants to join in? The response wasn't exactly what I expected. One guy replied back saying, I don't need any fancy ingredients like eggs, flour and sugar. I've already got mayonnaise in the fridge. What else am I missing? Another person responded by saying, no thanks, I prefer crisps. Then another reply comes back. He says, excuse me guys, I'm allergic to most types of bread including pancake mix. So therefore I won't be able to partake in today's culinary activities. Now, before I continue talking, I must explain that all four individuals live together in the same property. All right, so I took it upon myself to educate each of them further and decided to write out individual labels explaining which meals belonged to whom. Just to clarify, Mike eats the spicy vegetable curry while Chris has the roast beef sandwich. Dante does not touch the cheese board. Kev please keep your hands off my vegetarian quiche. Mike no longer lives with his old housemates anymore because he left to pursue better things. He's living in New York City. Thank you very much, enjoy the rest of your evening. Take care. Have fun. Thank you. Cheers!
