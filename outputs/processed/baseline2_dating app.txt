I'm going to tell you something about me before I get into this story.  Before I do it though, let's just set some things straight with y'all real quick.  Yes! Yes! Thank you so much!  Thank you so much. My name is Ali Sadiq. I am gay as fuck.  And if your sexual preference is not one of these three letters, then we don't got shit to talk about right now  But that being said uh i live my life pretty openly as an openly gay man which means people see me all over town like restaurants bars whatever  and sometimes they'll come up to me and be like hey mister why'd god make you gay um because he wanted somebody around to clean his house but also he was bored.  That's how God works. That's how God created us.  He gets bored at night. He makes new stuff. You know what? It doesn't matter.  It's okay. We're here. Let's move forward.  So I've been doing online dating again recently.  Now, I hate online dating, obviously.  We all hate online dating except for women who actually find love through it.  Those bitches are fucking geniuses.  They should teach them in school. They would have better Tinder profiles than math equations.  All right?  When girls succeed, everybody wins.  Guys lose every time.  Because when you go out there to meet dudes, guys always want more from their matches than they give back.  Like men will say stuff on their profile pictures like, six feet tall, athletic build, loves hiking.  Then when they match with someone, it's just, oh my God, hi! Oh my God, thank you so much for liking me.  Oh no, I saw your pic and I thought, damn, look at those pecs. Damn, that ass looks nice too.  But she didn't ask anything.  She asked herself questions.  What does that mean by athletic build?  Does that mean you run marathons?  Or did you play college basketball for two years until you hurt your knee?  Let me keep swiping till I figure it out.  I can't trust nobody.  Men lie.  Women lie. Everybody lies. Nobody tells the truth anymore.
