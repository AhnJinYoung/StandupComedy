My name's Harriet. I'm a working mum.  I work as an actress but what that means is I wait tables to pay my mortgage  and then one day at Waitrose I was doing this job where you pick up stuff people don't need so they can get free money back.  And it got me thinking about food waste.  So now when we go shopping, instead of going down any aisle just buying whatever takes our fancy, we're actually only allowed to buy things if there already exists a plan for them within our household.  We've all done it before haven't we? You open your fridge door, think oh, pasta salad sounds nice today.  But then you look inside the fridge and you see two different types of cheese, some leftover chicken from last night, half a cucumber, mayonnaise, tomatoes... Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, no. That's not how it works anymore. No more happy accidents with your groceries.  It's gone too far because now even the appliances themselves are getting chatty.  They'll be like, ooh, what do you want for dinner?  Pasta salad! Oh, great choice!  What time would you say you'd eat?  Oh, seven-ish maybe eight.  All right, good call.  Why don't I just take care of that for you?  Just put everything into baskets for you.  Thank you very much.  There you go.  Baskets ready.  Have a lovely evening.  Sorry, mate.  This isn't happening.
