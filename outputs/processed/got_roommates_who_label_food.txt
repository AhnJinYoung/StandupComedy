I live with two guys, right? And one of them's an asshole because he labels everything that he cooks or buys with his name on it so I don't eat it like this is how you know someone doesn't want to be friends with you when they're labeling their shit all the time.
Like last week we had our first roommate meeting where we were supposed to talk about boundaries but really what happened was my roommate Brian just yelled at me for eating his hummus.
I wasn't even hungry. He brought home this giant container of hummus from Whole Foods, which is disgusting. You can get better stuff at Costco.
But apparently it didn't make him feel good enough to go back there, so he bought another tub. Then he wrote HUMMUS IN THE FRIDGE in Sharpie across the top.
And then he left town before anyone else got home, hoping that no one would find out.
So I walk into the apartment after work, see this huge red warning label staring me down. Like, oh shit, who did that? Probably not gonna eat that now.
 Now, here's the thing though. We have a very open relationship. If something belongs to somebody specifically, they write their fucking name in big letters across the front.
 If something belongs to everybody, nobody writes anything.
So if nothing belonged to anybody, why does it say BRIAN'S HUMMUS IN BIG LETTERS ACROSS THE FRONT OF THIS CONTAINER THAT BELONGS TO EVERYBODY?
So... It says that because he wants it to belong only to himself.
 This guy has such a bad case of ownership issues.
 Well, he gets up real early every morning and goes running around Lake Michigan by himself as well.
 But anyway, I'm telling people like, hey man, your friend Steve, he should do CrossFit. They'll tell me yeah, dude, he loves doing crossfit. That's why he calls himself meathead.
