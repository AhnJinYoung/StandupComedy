You know what's wild about driving tests? They're like the ultimate stress-test – not just for you, but also for your examiner. I mean, have you ever seen an adult person sweating bullets while trying to parallel park? It's like they're competing on 'The Great British Baking Show,' except instead of cakes, it's three-point turns.  And then there's the joy of getting feedback from your examiner. You know, the kind that makes you question every life choice you've made since puberty? Like when they say, 'This is incorrect because... (pauses)...you forgot to check your mirrors.' Oh no! The horror!  I failed my driver's test five times before passing. Five! That means I had five different examiners who got to experience me yelling at myself in a car with hazard lights flashing. One even asked if I was okay after I screamed at the mirror-checking sign. My response? A sweaty smile and a mumbled, 'Yeah, yeah, totally fine.'  But honestly, failing those exams taught me something valuable how to make small talk with strangers while pretending I'm interested in road safety. Now that skill will come in handy someday.
