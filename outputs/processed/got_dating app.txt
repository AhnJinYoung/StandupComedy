I've been on this thing called Bumble, has anyone else heard of it?
It's like Tinder but when you swipe to match with somebody they have the option to just send you back an image rather than words which is nice I think that's quite sweet actually because sometimes if someone sends me something really cheesy or cringey I'm like oh my god get away from me how dare you.
But now there's only pictures so even though he might be saying something stupid his picture will make up for it right? Or maybe I'll meet someone who doesn't know what Bumble is and we can both live our lives free from judgment. That'd be cool.
So I was swiping through and I got matched with some guy and sent him straight back a picture of myself and then he did the same as well.
But here's the problem guys, my phone decided to autocorrect me and turn my name into penis.
I didn't even know what had happened until like five minutes later when his dick came up on the screen.
Instead of saying sorry about that what i actually wrote is send us all your nudes we're going to keep them safe you know like a penis museum or something so i've been sending random dudes pictures of my vagina just trying to get it back.
And so instead of just sending it over like normal, my phone went, oh no, we can't do that. We're gonna change you to penis.
I'm sorry! My dad is very upset because he can't get Tinder anymore.
He sends it back now so now there's two penises on Tinder matching.
I don't think it would have worked if it had just been accidental.
So now we're just having sex while looking each other up on Google.
So now there is no way to distinguish between his dick and mine.
So now every time we text each other it says hello from penis can i come over
