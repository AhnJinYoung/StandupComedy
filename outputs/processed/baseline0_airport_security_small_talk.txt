You know what's wild about airport security? The conversations we have with complete strangers while taking off our shoes.  'Where you headed?' 'Oh, New York.'  That's not an answer; that's a city. I've got no idea if you're going to Times Square or Central Park. You might be on a mission to rob a bank or attend a Broadway show – who knows?  I had one guy say he was heading home for his grandma's birthday party. And then five minutes later, another person asks him where they were from originally... Turns out this same dude is actually British but has been living in Australia since college. Grandma must love international travel!  And don't even get me started on when someone says their destination without any context at all – just deadpan 'Miami.' Like it's a declaration of independence rather than a flight number.
