So I saw this text message that my dad had sent me.  I'm pretty sure he got it from his grandkids because no grown man sends a heart emoji to anyone ever  and then i said hey you know what's weird about your generation is how much they use these little symbols called emojies right like every time we go online  we see those things all over the place but i feel like our parents didn't really grow up with them so now when they do send us one it seems kind of out of character  but also if anything i think it makes their texts seem more sincere especially coming from dads because at least once per week i get some email from my dad where everything inside the subject line reads i love you too much son  right? He'll be like, yo, bro, can you stop texting me during work hours?  And then just below it, he has an arrow pointing down.  It's like, yeah, buddy! It's great!  But my favorite was when my mom sent me an email saying she was running late picking me up from JFK airport by half an hour.  She included three planes taking off into the sky.  Like, oh, shit, mommy's gonna miss her flight.  This isn't happening.
