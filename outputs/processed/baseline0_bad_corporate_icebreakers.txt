You know what's wild? Corporate team-building exercises that promise to break down barriers, but really just make you want to scream at your coworkers.  I was at this conference last week where they did the classic 'Two Truths and a Lie' game. You know, where everyone shares two true statements about themselves and one false statement, hoping someone will call out the lie?  But let me tell you, it backfired when our CEO said his two truths were 'I love dogs,' and 'I have three kids.' And then he dropped the bombshell 'My third kid is secretly a ninja.'  We all looked at each other like, 'Uh, isn't this guy married?' (pause)  And don't even get me started on the trust fall. I mean, who thought that was a good idea after college? 'Hey, let's recreate the thrill of freshman year!' No thanks, I'm good.  (cue laughter)
