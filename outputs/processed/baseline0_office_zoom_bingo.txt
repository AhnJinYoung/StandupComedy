You know what's wild about Zoom meetings? Office Bingo. (pauses) I mean, who comes up with this stuff? 'Get five people on screen at once.' That's not a game; that's just my family dinner.  But seriously though, have you ever noticed how everyone gets so invested in their bingo cards during those virtual team-building sessions? It's like we're all competing to see who can spot the most unmuted cat or poorly lit kitchen counter.   And don't even get me started on the squares – 'Someone says synergy without using it correctly', 'A manager uses Comic Sans for the first time'... These aren't games of chance; these are social commentary!  I'm pretty sure if they added 'The CEO falls asleep mid-meeting' square, I'd be winning every single time.
