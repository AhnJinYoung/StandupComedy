A lot of guys like to ask this question.  They'll go, hey man, what do you think about when it comes to your ideal partner? You want someone who's smart?  Yeah! Yeah, I feel that way too.  I don't know if anyone else feels this way either but i'm not looking for anybody really dumb because then i'd be stupid  i would just end up with some guy who doesn't even understand sarcasm so he thinks everything i say is real  like we're arguing over whether or not pineapples belong on pizza and he thinks I mean it  that's not cool right now  if you meet somebody online, they always tell you never send money to strangers  but every girl on Tinder looks exactly alike, which means there is no stranger risk  What am I supposed to do? Not swipe left until she sends me her Venmo information first?
