I feel like I'm getting older too because now my friends think it's their job to tell me what music is good.  They're always trying to get me into new stuff that they think will change my life.  And every time, without fail, when they recommend something to me, there'll be some part of the song where it goes against everything I believe about humanity.  Like recently one friend was recommending this band called Tame Impala.  Now if you don't know anything about Tame Impala, just go ahead and imagine your least favorite millennial telling you that he found an old CD in his dad's closet from back before CDs were cool.  He brought it home. He put it in a computer. And somehow made himself sound better than Fleetwood Mac  That's basically how much more psychedelic Tame Impala sounds like it would be great with some sort of ritual sacrifice.  But nope! Just guitar solos as far out as the ears can hear!  So we're listening to this track. It gets to the point where Kevin Parker sings...  'It wasn't love at first sight.'  Oh, man... Oh, well... Yeah. Love sucks, I guess.  Then another song comes up. Now I really hate myself. Because now I realize I've been going through phases of being sad my whole entire life.
