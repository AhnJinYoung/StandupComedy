My name is Andrew, I'm from New York City originally but now living in Los Angeles which has been great for me because it's allowed me to really become more myself like I used to be able to walk around New York with my shirt off all day long no problem nobody cared not anymore you guys see this body? Nobody cares! Not one person! But I have seen some new technology recently though. It's called ChatGPT. And if any of y'all don't know what that means, that just means artificial intelligence chatbot. I was chatting with this guy named Bart at work about how we were using these machines. He said he had tried it before. He said his experience wasn't good. Said when he first started talking to it, asked him why he wanted to use it, and he said something funny. He goes, well, I guess I'm lonely. So then the computer apologized after responding saying something very weird. Goes, oh, sorry, maybe I shouldn't ask personal questions. And then I realized, wait a minute, there might actually be a point where an apology could go too far. You think? Yeah, let's talk about that. Apologies should be reserved only for those who've done real harm or made mistakes they can correct, right? Like, imagine you're driving down the highway and you rear-end somebody, okay? That would warrant an apology. Or even better than that, imagine you get into bed next night, and you hear someone else come home. They knock on bedroom door. You open up the door. There's your wife standing there. She says, hey babe, listen, uh, earlier today... I hooked up with another man. Oh yeah? Oh yes she did. Okay, thank you so much, thank you so much. That'd make me feel way better, wouldn't it? No, please do apologize again, ma'am. Please keep going. Go ahead. Nope. Nope, absolutely nothing makes her sound worse, does it? Like, it sounds like she wants us to hate her already. She doesn't need our help to ruin their reputation. Just tells us she cheated, walks away confidently. We'll figure out later exactly how bad things got. We always do. If anything happens between two people, eventually everybody finds out. Eventually everyone knows everything. The world gets smaller every single year, folks. So when people start giving unsolicited apologies early, it feels manipulative, right? It seems insincere. Like try telling your girlfriend you love her after sex for the second time in a row. Go ahead, give it a shot. Try it. See if you don't end up looking crazy doing it. Just say it once, twice, three times. Yeah, baby girl, I mean it this time. Mm-mm. Say it four times. One thing. Baby girl, I love you. Five times. Love you. Six times. Love you. Seven times. Eight times. Nine times. Love you. Ten times. Eleven times. Twelve times. Thirteen times. Fourteen times. Fifteen times. All right, sweetie, sixteen times tonight. Seventeen times tomorrow morning. Now look over there. Look outside through that window. What do you see? A police car pulling up outside our apartment building. Why are the cops coming inside? They found evidence that suggests you murdered your own mother last week in front of her cat. Because when people tell you they love you seventeen different ways, they want you dead, sweetheart. All right, officers, take her away. You've been wonderful. My name is Andrew Vogel. Goodbye.
