You know what's wild? Gym mirrors. Those things are like social media for fitness enthusiasts, but with more sweat and less likes.  I mean, have you ever been to the gym during peak hours? It's like everyone's competing in some sort of bizarre Olympics – except instead of running or jumping hurdles, they're all flexing their muscles and making duck faces at themselves.  And then there's the classic move checking out one's own behind while pretending not to notice anyone else around them. I'm pretty sure that's just code for 'I've got nothing better to do than admire my butt.'  But let me tell you about the real MVPs – those guys who take selfies mid-workout, grunting away on the treadmill or bench press. They're like, Oh, look! My biceps are so big... *flex*...my phone is going to be jealous! Give us a break!  It's also hilarious when someone spots an imperfection in their reflection (a stray hair, perhaps?) and suddenly becomes engrossed in correcting it, completely forgetting why they even came to the gym in the first place. Newsflash nobody cares if you get rid of that single errant strand; we're over here trying to keep our legs from buckling under the weight rack.  Gym mirrors might seem harmless enough, but honestly? They're breeding grounds for insecurity and narcissism – two qualities no one needs in excess, especially after a good workout. Maybe next time I'll bring a sign that says, Please check yourself before wrecking others' reflections. That'd definitely make for some interesting gym small talk!
