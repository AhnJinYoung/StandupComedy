I called my dad's computer guy once.  Yeah! He was like, so what seems to be the problem? And I'm like, yeah, it just won't turn on.  And he goes, oh no, that is terrible!  So we need you to go plug it into another outlet real quick because if your father's house has any faulty wiring then we're going to know about this by the end of today  so i plug it into an outlet and it turns right back off again  and i said well that's weird do you think there might be something wrong with the computer itself?  He went, why would anything as magnificent as technology fail when all that happens around us is perfect?  It turned out not to be the faultiest wiring at his place.  Also, who says that?  My mom calls me every day to ask how her Facebook account works.
