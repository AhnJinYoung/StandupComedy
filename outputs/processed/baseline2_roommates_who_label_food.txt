I used to live with two guys that were just like eating buddies.  They would eat everything together. They'd go out to lunch together every day, come back and watch TV, you know?  And I'm not saying they're gay or anything because, um... You see? Because it's weird if you put your arm around me now, so...  But when we lived there, it was always, hey! What do you want for dinner tonight, bro? And they had this rule where any time one person cooked something, they got to write their name on the side of the fridge what they made.  So then whoever goes to heat up whatever is left over later can tell whose leftovers those are.  It sounds simple enough but these dudes took it way too far.  Like my roommate Mike would cook some chicken breasts he would write mchickenbreast on his handwriting i don't even know how he knew  and then my other roommate steve he wasn't good at spelling either he would be cooking beef stew and then he would write s-beefstew on the side of the fridge  you ever notice when people aren't great spellers their misspellings get more creative though right yeah they start doing crazy stuff  i mean why would anybody take the time to add an extra letter into the word stew anyway  he could've been lazy and done better than that if he wanted to like instead of writing sbeefstew he should have written stew  but nope that guy went all in didn't care he wrote double-e-f-stew  That's not necessary dude!  If somebody comes along three weeks from today and sees SBEFFSTEW on the fridge, they're gonna think Steve's dead.
