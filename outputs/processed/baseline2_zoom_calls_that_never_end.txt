Yeah! I'm not gonna be your Zoom friend.  I had my first one recently when we were allowed to leave our houses again after lockdown number two.  And it was so good catching up with all these friends that I'd missed because they're far away from me now due to moving abroad to live their best lives without me.  But you know what? We got through those difficult times together via technology. And then there's this one particular friend who she is very nice but she wanted us to do another thing called a coffee date  and I just hate doing these coffee dates like i think if someone wants to see me they can meet me out socially let them buy me an overpriced cup of coffee and give me some change back than don't need to talk about stuff over zoom um  so anyway she sent me her email address which has been around since the dawn of time and I knew exactly how long it would take before she asked to call at least half an hour right?  So I prepared myself by making myself look presentable while wearing no clothes.  That's how much I didn't want to get ready.  Right, I click join meeting. She clicks join meeting five seconds later.  She goes, oh hi guys, thanks for joining. How are we feeling today?  We've both clicked off mute buttons as well. So we could hear ourselves breathe and pretend to say things we didn't actually mean to say.  Oh, I feel lovely, thank you for asking. Thank you. It's great being here with you guys.  Me too. Yeah, yeah, really enjoying the break from work as well.  Yeah, same here. Same here.  What line did you use to come into work today?  Uh... Why are we having small talk?  It's gone ten minutes already. What am I going to tell people I said during that conversation?  Like what do you think I should wear tomorrow? Should I go for bold colours or neutral tones?  Let's stop wasting everyone else's time.
