I got this card from my friend who's an artist.  She made it herself because she was bored at work during lockdown when we were all doing Zoom meetings.  And I think that's really funny if you're sitting there thinking about how much effort went into making one piece of paper look like another.  But then she sent me these cards to play Bingo with her online while we both worked remotely.  And so now every day before our meeting starts, I print out a new sheet.  It looks different every time. You know? Like today, just three boxes going horizontal.  Like what is happening here?  What kind of person comes up with this shit?  But... My favorite part is actually the terms and conditions on the back.  They say things like, do not use your camera or microphone unless absolutely necessary.  Oh! That sounds very strict.  Do not be late to the game.  If someone uses their camera or mic without permission, shout no!  That feels very passive aggressive doesn't it  and finally if anyone says the phrase i'm sorry again they lose two points but get double points for saying sorry not later  i thought oh yeah well why would anybody ever want to win at anything anyway right  but I've learned a lot since playing this game.  A few things I didn't realize.  One thing I didn't realise until recently is that men can multitask too.  Right, people always assume women cannot multitask.  I used to believe that myself.  Then I saw a man send a text message on his phone while he was being interviewed live on TV for a job as head chef at a children's hospital.  He did that twice before giving up and getting fired.  So uh maybe don't tell him that.  Also, some guys will turn off their cameras during virtual meetups even though they haven't been asked to.  Just disappear completely behind a wall of silence.  Don't take it personally, ladies.  Men often go missing mid-conversation in real life too.  We'll talk to them for years.  Next thing you know, gone forever.
