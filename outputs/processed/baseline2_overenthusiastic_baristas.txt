I'm going to tell you guys something about me.  This is not easy for me to admit as an adult.  But I still like coffee with a little bit of foam on it. You know what I mean?  Like when they just squirt out all that milk at once and then pour it into your cup so there's some extra milk right here in the corner where no one else can see it but you get to enjoy it  And if you're lucky enough to order their fancy drink like a latte macchiato whatever that means...  ...then you gotta pay $10 more dollars than everyone else who ordered regular old black coffee because that's how much they charge you per layer of froth that you want.  It's insane!  Now, I live near Starbucks because my dad works here every day at this Starbucks.  So we go there together sometimes. And he loves them too. He thinks they make him feel good about himself.  We'll walk up. We got our list written down by number. We don't mess around.  My dad always starts off strong. Right? Like really confident. Walks up to counter, gives his name, says the first item on his list.  They write it down. They ask us another question.  Second thing comes next, same confidence.  Then we start getting repetitive questions from these baristas. Different ones.  They don't remember anything from last time either.  The second-to-last person asked me why I wanted whipped cream on my hot chocolate.  Why do you think she didn't give it to me? She was like, oh, yeah! That's disgusting! No way!  I'm like, well, excuse me, ma'am. But according to the menu board behind you, those two things are actually made for each other.  She didn't care. She wouldn't listen.  One guy took forever making my mom her usual cappuccino.  He finally finished after three minutes.  Hands back to my mother said, hey miss here is your normal cappuccino would you prefer whole wheat crust or white bread for your croissant?  That's a different breakfast food altogether. She didn't even laugh though which tells me maybe she'd never been inside before.  Maybe she thought it was a real restaurant.
