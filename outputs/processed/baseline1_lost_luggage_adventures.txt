I hate flying, you know what I mean? Like, don't get me wrong, I love to travel. That's really cool. But it always seems like when we're getting ready to fly, something bad is gonna happen with my bags, right? You know how that goes around. So before every flight now, just for good luck, I do this thing where I put my bag on the carousel at security so they can see it there but then take off running through security like an idiot until I'm out of sight from them. And then by the time I come back and the conveyor belt has turned all the way around again, hopefully mine will be sitting next to yours, okay? That happened once. It was amazing. We were both doing the same thing. And he looked up at me and said, oh shit! What did you... what did you think? But no one else ever does it, which makes me look crazy. No matter who boards the plane first after us, none of these other people seem to care about their bags whatsoever! They walk down the aisle without looking or even glancing over at our bag twice. We've been married for seven years and had two kids together. This guy walks past our baby stroller three times without picking it up. It's unbelievable. The worst part is though is when you check a piece of luggage because if anything happens to that it costs money to replace everything inside it and yet airlines still make you go through airport security to pick it up afterwards. How much sense does that make? If TSA agents have already gone through it once why would anyone need to touch another agent today? Why not skip that step altogether and let everyone board the plane immediately upon arrival? Instead of waiting outside behind those yellow doors for ten minutes staring at some old man who's also been waiting too long. What kind of airline would do such a thing? Oh wait, almost any one of them. Right away. There used to be this lady working at Delta whose job was to call me personally whenever she found my missing suitcase anywhere within the entire airport. And yes, she literally called me directly on her cell phone while walking across concourse B. Because apparently she didn't want to disturb anybody else either. She'd say stuff like, hello Mr., please hold for a moment. Okay, thank you very much sir. Hi ma'am, may I speak with someone? Hello, hi, well, hello, um, excuse me, ma'am, could I talk to somebody? Hi, yeah, hey, hi, hi. Thank you. Thank you. Well, hello, hi, uh... Thank you. Hello, hi. Is that Mrs.? Ma'am, is this Mrs. Smith speaking? Yeah, hi, hi. Ma'am, sorry to bother you, but I am calling regarding the black suitcase tagged number C-7 that belongs to Mrs. Smith. Uh-huh. Yes, I understand you checked it last night. Yes, exactly, and uh... No, ma'am, nothing's coming out of that compartment. Well, anyway, just thought I should give you a heads up, alright? Thanks. All right. Bye-bye. Bye bye byebye. Byebidu du du. Bibbidi bobbidi boo.
