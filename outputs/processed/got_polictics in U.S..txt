I think that if you're going to go into politics, like you've got to be prepared for all of this stuff. Like, I don't know how Donald Trump did it, because he's never had any experience or anything before, but he went through so much shit with his family business and then reality TV.
And then he was just ready for president? Like, what happened there? Because no one else could have gone through everything that he went through during those two years and come out looking better on television than Hillary Clinton.
Like she didn't even get her own scripted show! What is happening?! It bums me out though, because we need more women in power right now. And especially black people, because white dudes are getting too many opportunities, honestly.
I want to see Oprah run. Or Beyonce. Any woman who has been an executive producer on their shows should definitely run for office.
Women running for office makes sense to me because they tend to focus on issues that really matter.
Because when men talk about policy, they always sound like a bunch of boys arguing over which Pokémon would win in a fight.
I was watching my friends have an argument on Facebook recently because I'm addicted to Facebook.
I'm sorry. Because when you look at politics, it's all just like, nope, Pikachu wouldn't do shit to Mewtwo.
I think it's because we've all been raised on the same thing since childhood.
Like I grew up watching Dragon Ball Z with my friends every day after school.
I think it's because we've never had to make decisions based on our own reproductive health.
Oh my God! Because I'm not going to lie fellas... When women argue about politics we do it completely differently than you guys because when men talk about policy they always sound like a bunch of boys arguing over who'd win in a fight.
They're all just doing it because someone dared them to.
Oh my god! You guys ever notice how whenever you ask politicians what their stance is on an issue? It's always so stupidly specific!
