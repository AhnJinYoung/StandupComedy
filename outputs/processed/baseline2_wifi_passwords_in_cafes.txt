My name is Neil. I live alone with my dog.  I'm not gonna say his name because he's asleep right now so that would be weird  but thank you very much everybody this is great to be here it's good to see some people who don't look like they work at a call center which is always nice  i just got back from ireland i was there for two weeks had an amazing time went to galway kinsale cork all the places man  galway has one of those little harbour streets where everyone wears a jumper even though it's summer it's lovely  if anyone hasn't been if you haven't been before when you get off your flight going to irish airport uh they've written out instructions about how to speak to them while you're over there really sweet  like no using colloquialisms such as yeah fair play but also we love tourists so feel free to use american phrases like hi buddy hope you having a good day dude it'll make us laugh  and then halfway down the page it goes please do not use the phrase top banjo okay obviously not funny to the locals anyway um  my favourite thing about being away from home is getting access to other countries' Wi-Fi networks mainly because none of ours work  that's what keeps me up at night mate thinking oh i could turn myself into a human router  all these devices connected to my body hotspots popping off everywhere i'd never leave the house again  so when i go abroad anywhere outside europe i love looking at their WiFi network names usually made by baristas and stuff  anyone else remember when coffee shops first started putting their own wireless internet in bars were one of the first places to put it in  it wasn't long after the invention of coffee itself actually when did humans decide they needed caffeine?  just wandering around the savannah drinking blood? What happened next?  No, seriously, someone explain it to me.  But if you're familiar with UK-based Costa Coffee chain, they used to have a password called 'letthemhaves'. Any fans of Glee among us today?  The term let them haves comes from Shakespearean English meaning give me more.  And I think that's quite ironic coming from costa coffee seeing as every single branch closed during lockdown due to covid-19  That said guys whenever i travel outside the uk i just find the wi-fi network names hilarious especially ones created by americans honestly so cute and naive  the best one i saw recently was called i believe in jesus christ that's pretty standard american fare  they're very open about religious beliefs aren't they didn't know if anybody knew this but apparently americans will write anything online without consequence  this guy lives in new york city probably works on wall street and yet still feels comfortable sharing his personal beliefs with strangers  he might as well have left a comment below saying something along the lines of I am a boy God bless America huh
