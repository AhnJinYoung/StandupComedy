Settled down with my girlfriend, she's really nice but she does have one of those new smart fridges where it tells you how long ago food was cooked and stuff like that.
Does anyone else know what I'm talking about?
It just makes little comments to me when we're hanging out.
The other day it said something very hurtful to me as well.
She went, oh no! Oh no! There goes your lunch again!
You can't get rid of it this time! You've got to eat it!
And she didn't know I was gay.
So now all my friends want me to come out on stage.
I was like, you know what? She's right, so... So then I ate my sandwich on her bed because she told me to.
 So I'm eating my sandwiches on her bed and obviously not gonna clean up after myself.
And then she comes home from work to see me covered in crumbs.
So when you say it's like being married but without the commitment, what do you mean? What does that even mean?
 I don't care if you live together or whatever for years, living together is fundamentally different than marriage.
Marriage should be like getting a cat. Like, I could have had that little guy all day long without committing to it.
Because married couples get to use the word forever. You know what I mean? Like they'll do shit like go on vacation and one of them will be like we're gonna have sex every day until we leave. And then when it's over they'll come back home and they'll be like till death do us part.
Because I think when you're married to someone for long enough it just becomes like an old roommate situation.
