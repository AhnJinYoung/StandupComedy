I am sick to death of these over-caffeinated b****** that work behind coffee shop counters, right?
They're like, what can I get you? What do you want today? They just go straight off on one, don't they?
What's wrong with them?
I think there should be some sort of age limit when people start working behind coffee shops or bars because if your personality is still developing inside your body, shouldn't that mean we hold back all those opportunities for you until later?
Can you imagine being 15 years old in McDonald's?
 I would come up every day after school, order a Big Mac meal, then instead of asking me which size sauce, ask me what my favourite flavour was.
 And I'd say, sweet and sour. And he'd take two squirts from each bottle and mix it together.
 So now I'm nine years old walking home through an alleyway and this guy comes out of nowhere goes, excuse me mate, how much does your mum weigh?
 Now, as any normal nine-year-old kid would have done, I looked down at his feet went oh s*** oh no where did i put him give us um but no not me
 i panicked so i ran across the road to see her well she came running towards me she said nick tell me what he asked why did he ask that question
I'll never forget it. Because she turns around runs back over to my house and then comes out with my dad holding a big brown envelope.
I said, because you're my best friend's mum.
Then just to make things worse, I had to explain what an orgy was.
I said because of all these f****** trees around here you've got to be careful it's like being an auntie right if you're an auntie when one of your nieces or nephews asks you a question you don't know how do you answer it
I was like ah because you were having sex with my dad.
