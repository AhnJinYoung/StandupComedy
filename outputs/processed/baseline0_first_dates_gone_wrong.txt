So, I've been on my fair share of first dates – some good, most bad, all memorable. You know what they say 'the third date is where things start getting real.' But honestly, it's usually around the second date that you find out if there's even hope for anything beyond Tinder.  I was at this coffee shop recently, trying to make small talk with someone who seemed genuinely interested... until she asked me about my cat. Not just any question, mind you – but one that started with do you have any pets? followed by an aggressive interrogation. Is he cute? Does he like treats? What's his name?  Now, I'm not saying I don't love animals; I do! In fact, I think cats rule the world right now (ask anyone whose house has ever been taken over). However, when your potential partner asks more questions than a journalist during Watergate, alarm bells should be ringing.  On another occasion, I met up with someone who claimed to enjoy hiking. Sounds great, right? That is, until we arrived at the park only to realize their idea of 'hiking' involved walking five feet uphill before proclaiming exhaustion and needing to sit down.  At least once a month, I hear from friends who're stuck on these awkward dates because they didn't Google their matches beforehand or just plain ignored red flags. It's time to take responsibility, guys!  All jokes aside though, dating can indeed be tough. There was one lady who ordered two extra shots after our drinks were served. Okay, maybe that isn't so strange. Yet then proceeded to drink them both while talking non-stop about her ex-boyfriend throughout dinner...  But hey, being single means still having room to grow – personally speaking, anyway. Or perhaps more accurately put plenty of practice material.
