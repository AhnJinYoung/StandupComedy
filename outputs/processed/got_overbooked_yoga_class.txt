Set up I was just trying to get some exercise because you know when you're on vacation you want to do stuff but then sometimes like things happen right so i signed up for this thing it's called an over booked yoga class that sounds great doesn't it yeah no one likes undersubscribed activities especially if they have the word book in them right absolutely, don't even need any context.
So what happens is there should be only five people doing it, but everybody wants to do it. So we all pay $25 each to go into a room with three other strangers.
It turns out overbooked is code for there's only two people coming so we all take our mats off fold them into triangles put them under each other form a pile and then the instructor starts teaching us downward-facing dog.
So basically what happens is everyone shows up, not enough mats. Then someone calls a gym, gets sent another person who has no idea where he is.
I walked into my first day of Overbooked Yoga Class. They were very excited about me coming back every single day.
 And now let me tell you how exciting my life got by going to Over Booked Yoga. All right? Now my daily routine started to look something like this.
 At six o'clock in the morning, wake up early, jump into bed, start snoring loudly.
 Then the alarm clock goes off, jolt myself awake, realize I've been sleeping through my own alarm, panic, rush around the house until I find the battery that went missing from the last time, throw it onto the clock, turn it on again.
 Run downstairs naked, grab my mat, run outside, lock the door behind me, unlock it immediately, open the fridge to steal milk from my roommate's apartment.
 Drink the cold milk down, feel it chill me all the way to the bottom of my stomach.
 Now, once inside the van, I would pretend that I'm driving while simultaneously checking my phone for text messages.
