You know what's wild? Roommates who label their food like it's a hostage situation, Don't eat my pizza...I mean, don't even think about eating my pizza. (pause) I'm not kidding, they put stickers on the containers with dates – like we're trying to solve a mystery together. The tuna was eaten between Tuesday at 6 PM and Wednesday at 10 AM by an unknown roommate. (laughter)  And then there's the labels that say things like 'not mine' or 'do not touch.' It's like, dude, if you didn't want me to eat it, why did you buy it?! Now I've got this leftover lasagna that says 'don't eat' on it. That just tells me one thing someone's really invested in being right about whose lasagna is whose.  But honestly, can you blame them? If I had to deal with people raiding my fridge all day, I'd be labeling everything too. Although now I have this great idea for a new business venture Labelled Leftovers Inc. We'll sell pre-labeled leftovers online and watch our customers' relationships crumble from afar! (applause)
