I went to an all-women's college.  The only guys that were allowed there is if they worked as staff members at the school.  So I had some hot young dudes working here.  They're like, oh yeah, we got some guy friends coming up this weekend.  We can bring them back to our dorm rooms?  No! You may not bring any men into your bedroom!  It was a very strict policy.  My favorite one though, my absolute favorite one was like, no, but you could have sex with us outside of campus hours  And i'm like what do you mean by outside of campus hours because i don't know how long it takes to get around campus  But then also who's keeping track?  Like, did someone tell? Was it me telling?  I think maybe that's why I didn't date anyone while I was there.  Because I was always worried about getting caught having sex.  That's probably why I never dated anybody there.  Now when I go out to eat now people ask where should I sit in the restaurant?  Where would be good for two people to sit?  In a booth alone together.  Don't even need that many seats either.  Just enough so I'm comfortable leaning against something.  Thank you.
