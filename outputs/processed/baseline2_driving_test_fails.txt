I'm having my driver's license taken away.  It is so annoying because I've been practicing to pass it since last year  but apparently you can't just practice your driving test every day like that  you're not good at golf right i don't think anyone who watches this show is really into their sports but if you were great at golf wouldn't be allowed to keep playing until you got better would they yes no okay well why does anybody get to drive cars then honestly when did we ever agree on this oh yeah one time there was too many people crossing red lights and somebody said let someone else try how about him he seems nice give me a chance hey man come back next week maybe we'll talk again  So what happened?  My instructor rang up two weeks ago and she goes, hi John, I need to tell you something. You failed your test today.  And I went, ah! And she says, I know, I thought so as soon as I saw you pull out from the stop sign!  Which isn't true by the way. She didn't even see me do anything wrong.  She's making all this shit up off her head. It's very stressful trying to fail an exam while simultaneously being attacked personally by another person.  But anyway.  That wasn't the reason I failed.  The real reason I failed... the examiner pulled me over after three minutes and told me to turn left ahead.  Now here's where things start getting quite complex with regard to road safety and physics.  If you go straight on, you will crash into a lamp post.  If you turn left now, you may kill yourself.  What am I supposed to do? There's only one thing you're supposed to do in that situation according to the Highway Code. Yes, signal which direction you intend to go.  Then put on your indicator light and hope to God nobody sees either of those signals before you make your move.  This guy didn't fall for it though.  He looked down both roads and picked the least likely place for me to end up dead.  Or worst case scenario, killed loads of innocent bystanders along the way.
