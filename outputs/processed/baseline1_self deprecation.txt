I'm from LA originally, which is interesting because I look like this now. But growing up my parents were Mexican immigrants so they wanted to raise me in Spanish but at one point we just got lazy so instead of speaking English with them i would speak spanish to them but then switch to english when it was convenient for me. So if you ever want to hear that conversation play a game of catch me if you can with me. And sometimes what happens too is people will get confused about where my accent comes from or how do I sound American? Because on paper I don't make sense right? Like culturally I have no idea who Taylor Swift is, but grammatically I am correct every time. I feel like I should be teaching ESL somewhere, you know? But I think part of why I started doing accents though was to help hide my own voice. Like whenever I try to sing, I end up sounding like a bunch of dogs having sex together, honestly. It's very unsettling. My friends tell me, oh, Drew, you gotta work out more. You've been working out less than any other comic in the room tonight. Yeah, yeah. And I say, well, maybe if y'all stopped laughing all the time, I could afford to go back to CrossFit, okay? This isn't an excuse. It's not my fault that I'm only two-thirds muscle by volume. A lot of times I'll get mad at myself after shows like this. If the set doesn't land, I hate going home afterwards feeling sad about myself. What bothers me most, actually, is when somebody tells me after a show something along these lines... They're like, man, you really opened yourself up emotionally on stage. Thank you so much. Yeah, you guys really made me cry. Oh, thank God! Oh, I need that. Which makes me realize... I shouldn't open up on stage! No wonder nobody laughed during that last joke. I literally said, hey everybody, let's all hug each other. Let's become new besties. That is the dumbest shit I've ever said. Why did I do that? Every single person in this room has better things to do than watch some dude talk about himself before midnight. Don't clap for that nonsense. Now put those hands down. We are at capacity. The fire marshal told us to stop letting strangers touch one another. Stop touching. Not yet. Okay. Sorry. Hey, there's a couple dudes backstage. There's also a woman. She's fine looking. She looks good. She's hot. And she wants to come out. She's scared. She won't leave her dressing room. Do anybody want her to come out? Everybody in unison says yes. Great. Good to see that we still believe in love, huh? Everyone agrees. We're all horny losers. Even him over there. He thinks he hates dating apps, but deep inside he loves his phone more than anything else in life. We're all horned loser assholes. Anyway, she's coming out. Here she goes. Hi everyone.

Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. Y'all laughin' at me? Yo, I had a baby recently. I mean, yeah, it happened. Shit hit the fan. All right, that's cool. I saw a lady the other day. She looked like my wife. Looked exactly like my wife. I thought she was my wife for a second until I realized it wasn't. Then I felt bad, you understand? Cause you always wish someone else was dead. Bunch of weirdos in here tonight. Damn. You ain't never heard of me, motherfucker? Who the fuck are you? I grew up in a tough neighborhood called East New York, Brooklyn. East New York, that's hood-ass ghetto, nigga. Nigga, you wouldn't even take a shortcut through that shit. Just shoot me, doggie. Gotta keep walking. East New York, niggas sell crack out of the trunk of cars. Nigga, y'all got guns pointed at children. Hear shots ringing out. Nigga, kids playing outside. Parents yelling, hey, turn around. Go inside. Kids running away. Gunman pointing gun at kid. Kid run faster. Gunman shooting bullet at ground level. Bullet hits car tire. Tire blowout. Car crash. People jumping out of wrecked car screaming. Police sirens approaching. Get down. Asshole. White cops pulling up. Black ass police officers jump out. Nigger, drop your weapon. Pigs, pigs everywhere. I live in Fort Greene Park. Fort Greene Park, that's hipster heaven, bitch. Hipsters, they gentrify neighborhoods. Make everything safe for white people. Put up vintage street signs. Vintage street signs. White people walk under vintage street sign. Reads Niggress Avenue. Laughing. Hell yeah, bro. Take pictures. Text message it to friend. Dude, check out this black history monument. Send picture to Facebook profile picture frame. Frame reads, where I do it? Where I do it? Well, according to Google Maps, you do it on 123rd Street and Lenox Avenue Harlem, New York City. I went hiking once. Got lost in woods for seven hours straight. Seven goddamn hours. Guy found me crying. Found me sitting next to stream. Crying. He asked, yo, what happened? I said, nothing. He's like, nah, bro, there's blood all over your face. What the hell happened? I said, I fell into tree branches. He's like, you must be bleeding pretty badly. You might die soon. I didn't respond. Might die soon. Maybe I'll wake up tomorrow morning. Fuck you, dude. Whatever. I went rock climbing today. Sucks. Went skydiving yesterday. Felt great. I liked that. Ran into girl I used to date. Hadn't seen her since breakup six months ago. Six months later, same outfit. Same shirt, same shorts, different belt buckle. Different belt buckle. I was happy. I was like, wow, I guess she likes me, whatever. Turns out she bought new clothes six years ago. Didn't wash them. Kept wearing them dirty. Six months pass. Still hasn't washed them. Doesn't matter. I didn't care. I was just glad she came crawling back. Girlfriend broke up with me two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, she gave me the old ruse. Left town for vacation. I was like, ah, damn. Did she break up with me while I slept? Or did she sneak up behind me? Slap me in the mouth, kiss my forehead goodbye. Say, suck it, nigga. Tell your mama bye-bye, nigga. Call me when you find Jesus. Jesus, call me, nigga. I walked outside. Sun shining bright. Bird chirping. Clouds fluffy. Feeling peaceful. Thought to myself, what the fuck is wrong with women? Women act crazy. They freak out over stupid stuff. Ladies, calm down. Act normal. Love men again. Men love sane women. Men fall in love with nice girls. Nice girls get married. Happy marriage. Men marry nice girls. When I grow up, I hope to have a wife who acts reasonable. Reasonable. One guy asked me advice recently. He said, Roy, I'd like to ask you some questions. Could you answer them truthfully? Please ask me whatever you want to ask. Ask me anything. First question, you ever cheated on a girlfriend? Yes or no. Yes. Second question, ever lied about cheating? Yes or no. Yes. Third question, do you regret lying about cheating? Yes or no. Yes. Last question, do you think honesty is important in relationships? Yes or no. No. All right, thanks. Alright, everybody. Give it up for Roy Woods. Roy Woods, everybody. New York, New York.
