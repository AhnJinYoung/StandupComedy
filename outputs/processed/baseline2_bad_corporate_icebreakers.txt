I work at an insurance company.  Does anybody here work in insurance? No? Good! It's awful!  It is so boring.  There was this one day I had to do something called a team building exercise because apparently my job sucks enough already that we need another thing.  So what happened was they took us all off site to some hotel conference room and there were like six people from our office there plus two other offices who worked with me  And basically it just said write down three things about yourself on index cards you know like your name where you live how old you are whatever and then pass them around to everybody else at the table read somebody else's card take note of their answers go back to yours add new questions based on information gathered then repeat process until time runs out  That sounds simple but trust me it takes way too long because every single person has nothing going on in their life whatsoever except maybe one guy named Brian who got divorced recently which by the way not even cool dude.  Like if anything that means now he gets two-thirds of his stuff back right?  But instead of doing it like that what they did was they put everyone into groups of four, and you would sit across from someone you don't know yet, and then they handed you these paper plates.  They're like, okay, write something true about yourselves on your plate.  Then when the music starts playing, pick up the plate next to you and read everything written on it and see if you can come up with something truthful to say about yourself as well without repeating any of those words exactly.  Then put your own plate over top and keep reading the next ones underneath and get better and better responses until the song ends.  Okay, so what happens is like once the first person reads the second person's statement and writes down something good and passes it along and puts their own statement under, now the whole group thinks they can be cleverer than the previous person.  By the end, everybody becomes an absolute dickweed, saying shit no one should ever hear about anyone else.  This girl was like, oh yeah, I went skydiving last year and I'm afraid of heights.  Oh boy, she really wants attention.  The worst part though was later that same week, we actually became coworkers.  Now I feel obligated to hang out with her outside of work sometimes.  She asked me to watch her dog while she goes away.  If nobody knows anything dumber, tell me now.
