"Script: You know what's wild? We spend an hour on our mats, trying to breathe deeply, find inner peace... only to be kicked out of the studio because we're five minutes late for 'Detox Flow'. I mean, it's not like we're showing up to therapy after skipping lunch – \"Sorry doc, traffic.\" (pauses)\n\nBut seriously, have you ever tried to get into that one popular yoga spot downtown? It's like trying to score tickets to a Beyoncé concert. They tell you, if there's still space available at all, sign up online by Wednesday or forfeit your chance to downward-dog with the Instagram influencers.\n\nI went once; signed up, showed up early, got my mat ready... they told me the class was full due to some'sudden popularity' and offered me a 'waiting list.' Like, do people actually put their names down for something just so they can say no thanks when asked if they want to join the waiting list?\n\nAnd don't even get started on how competitive it is to leave before savasana starts. The person who leaves first gets bragging rights, probably. Or maybe it's just a desperate attempt to beat rush-hour traffic home. Either way, good luck finding parking near those studios. That'll give you some real inner peace! (laughs)"
