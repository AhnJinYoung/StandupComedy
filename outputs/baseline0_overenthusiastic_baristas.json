"Script: You know what's wild? When you order a coffee, but before they even make it, they've already decided to be best friends with you. (pause) \"I'M SO EXCITED TO MAKE YOUR LATTE TODAY! It's like I'm getting ready for prom or something – 'Who am I gonna wear?' 'Should I get a latte art heart or leaves?' \n\nAnd then when you ask them how their day is going, they launch into this epic story about... their cat's dental appointment. (sarcastically excited tone) Oh yeah, that's exactly why I came here today: to hear about Whiskers' root canal.\n\nBut honestly, have you ever noticed how much caffeine these people must consume just to keep up this level of enthusiasm all shift long? They're basically functioning on pure espresso fumes at this point. That's not a job, that's a lifestyle choice.\""
