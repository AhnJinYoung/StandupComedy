"Script:\n\n\"You know what's wild about open office spaces? The way people become territorial over their desks, like they're guarding a prized possession. (pause) I mean, have you ever walked by someone who's trying to 'claim' an empty desk with their laptop and coffee cup? It's like they're saying, 'Back off, this is my turf.'\n\nAnd then there's the seating arrangement – it's all about strategy. You've got the power brokers sitting near the CEO, the introverts huddled in the corner, and the social butterflies vying for spots at the watercooler. (laughter)\n\nI saw a guy the other day who put up a little sign on his cube that said, 'Do not sit.' Like he was a king or something! And another one who brought in a plant to make their space more... inviting. (chuckles)\n\nIt's funny because when we were kids, our parents used to tell us to share our toys. Now we're adults and we can't even give up our spot at the conference table without getting anxious.\""
